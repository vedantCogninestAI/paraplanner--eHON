(Page 13), "clive.martin: So, … Allison, still working." (Page 12), "George Williams: I tried to find out her pension pot the other day. Yep. And TPT, who it's with, have you heard of TPT? Can't they have TPT? They are… what's that stand for? I don't know. But anyway, their systems are being…. being transferred for the last 3 months, it's just been a nightmare. So many complaints about it. Anyway, anyway, it's done, and they finally did it, and I looked through, and she's got a healthy pot in there now of, like, I'm sure it's something like about 80 or 90,000 she's got in. So, I mean, we've always said, because she gets such good returns from her working and. No, no, no, no. contribution. Absolutely. But, I mean, it's getting to the stage now where she's saying… I mean, she's 70 this year. Well, I mean, I mean, I… I…. Yeah. I admire her, but she obviously still enjoys doing what she's doing, so, you know, if she still enjoys it, then who am I to say you don't know what you're doing? 100%, and that's what I say, you know. need to do it. You don't need to go to work. We're not, we're not, you know, need the money. Rap for cash. Yeah, I said, we don't need the money." (Page 12), "George Williams: She said… I think it will definitely be… I'll tell you why, she has to go through, … re-registration, which means revalidation, it's called, that's the word I was looking for. Revalidation, which means that she's had to have done all these courses during the year, do this, do that. Now, she renewed it last year, I think it was. And it lasts for 2 years. So, at some point this year, so next year, she will retire, definitely, and she will come off the bank. Because once… once you haven't been revalidated, she can't go back to work." (Page 12), "George Williams: Let me update you with Gareth. So, Gareth… a year ago, okay. … he… he fell out with a new director that had come in. So he was just one below the board, this new board member, director, had come from, quite a harsh PR company. He worked for… Gareth worked for Weber Shandwick, who are literally one or two in the world PR companies. And they brought in this other guy from… I can't remember the name of the company now, but it's their…. Other, number one, number two in the world. But they were always known as a very hard, harsh company. The directors, you know, if you don't perform, you're out, bang. Anyway, Weber got hold of him, he became Gareth's boss. And Gareth gets on with everybody, but this guy took an instant dis… dislike, or Gareth took an instant dislike to him about the way he was treated. or way he was treating him. Right, you're not going to live in Tahoe anymore, you're going to move back to San Francisco, da-da-da-da-da. And he said, no need to do that, that's why I was allowed to move here, etc. Anyway, they were making redundancies, and Gareth knew his name was at the top of the list. And, as Atoms last. I think it was about last May time, he was told. So, he was given quite a time for them, he was given about 2 months, 3 months to actually … you know, notice period, which he did, and he set up his own company called Human First. And it basically was just a PR company, and he had a lot of clients that wanted to work with him from previous clients that he'd dealt with. IBM, Digital, you know, there were large companies, and he sold… he didn't have to sell his services, they said, would you do this project for us, would you do that? And he was making a lot of money out of it. However, he… he didn't like the insecurity of running his own company. He's not that type of person. And he's always wanted to try and get out of the, the agency side, because, you know, he was agency side, and that's a completely different philosophy and work pattern of when you're actually working within a company. So, anyway, one of the people, that he met worked for a company called Syngenta. I don't know whether you've heard of Syngenta. Yes, I'll do nursing. You know, a multi-billionaire, a billion comfort, billion pound company. Anyway, one of the guys contacted me and said, I've been chatting to one of my colleagues in IBM, and we have this position. open for, PR… A director, for comms, et cetera, da-da-da. And I would like to interview for it. So he went for the interview, he was interviewed by 2 or 3 people. Got down to the shortlist of two, and unfortunately he didn't get the job. Because, the guy who did get the job was a BBC, would you believe, journalist. who had all these contacts in the agricultural world. That was his job. Gareth didn't have that, because he's just come from a pure IT background. Yeah, sure. So… but the guy, his… one of the directors of Xinjiang, to turn around and said, Gareth, I really do like you, I like what you're portraying, I like what you're doing, da-da-da-da-da. He said, so… Bear with me, we're gonna give you a contract. For 6 months, on stupid money. he said, will you sign up for 6 months? So, this was in… by the time this was, in September time? No, later than that. It must have been about October time. He said, we'll give you a contract, but that's it. You have to get rid of all your other clients, we just want you for 6 months. And it was ridiculous money that he was offering. So Gareth said, yeah, but why? He said, because… I've got a… I need to find a role for you. And Gareth went, oh, alright, fair enough. So Gareth was very happy, he was getting paid oodles of money, and he really loved it. This… it gave him a new breath of life, because he was dealing with something he didn't know, agriculture. Who knows about agriculture when you're working in IT? But he… he'd learned about it, fantastically, and in February, the guy said, look, we… we're pretty certain we've got a job. In March, they said, we have got a job, but you need to now come over to Basel in Switzerland, where one of their base and their main directors are. Go over there and be interviewed. So he went over there, and he said, but we need you over here for two weeks. He went, oh, all right then. So, we went out there in the in-between weekend, and had a lovely weekend in Basel with him. But he was interviewed, got on with all the guys, and they finally, I think it was in about May, said, right, we'll offer you a job. Starting the 1st of August. That's slipped back to the 1st of September because of the problems of moving back. And they've basically said, you're on this salary. Which I've, like, fainted on. And they said. Where, and where's he based? he's… well, that's it. He's moving back to the UK. He's gonna be based, actually, in, Oxford. Well, not Oxford, it's in, Goring. I don't know whether you know Goring? I do not go against you. Yeah. So he's about 5 minutes out of Goring, where he's renting a place. Right. We have hired a van tomorrow, and I'm taking, literally, a massive long-wheelbase van with all his stuff that he left here 16 years ago, and other stuff we've bought. I bought him a car, I've had to lend him… Shed loads of money, because he's still trying to get his money out of the U.S. easily, and whatever. So, and that's another part I need to talk to you about. Anyway, this is a background. So, I'm delivering it all to a house that we finally rented accommodation in… in Goring, that he's moving into. It's a beautiful house, a 5-bedroom house. near enough right on the Thames. He's doing that, and he's moving, … So, we're moving everything tomorrow, going up there, it'll be tomorrow and Saturday to build stuff and do stuff and get, you know… you know what it's like, just… because they've got nothing. Their container is coming over with everything they own, and they… when I say they didn't own a lot, they lived in furnished accommodation. Yeah. Lake Tahoe. Yeah. So, he hasn't got loads of beds, so we've been having to buy beds and stuff like that from everywhere. Anyway, … They're moving into this place for a year while they look for a place up there, because that's where they want to live. One of their head offices is in Reading. another one in Bracknell, and he's got people up in Manchester. He flew over to China last week, because he's got a team over there, he's got a team in New York, he's got a team in San Francisco. Basically, what he's doing, he's heading up the AI for Syngenta in their comms. So it's all around AI comms, for… the process of what they're doing. I mean, it's amazing what he said, because he only knows so much about it, I know even less, but it's a matter of what fertilizer do you put in this ground. To give these results with this particular crop, or whatever. Yep. compared to the forecasts, you know, they're making. And AI is being able to create these chemicals and fertilizers and whatever to do this. Anyway, but I didn't know until recently, as he said, that it's a… it's now a Chinese-owned company. I didn't know that, but it's now Chinese-owned. Well. everyone seems… every company now seems to be owned by the Chinese, like, you know, I found out Volkswagen are owned by the Chinese as well, and you just… they're all owned by the Chinese, aren't they? Well, I mean, the, the other… going back to the whole commodity thing, the big thing is, is having, food and agriculture, and Syngenta is one of the biggest suppliers of fertilization of crop, so you're… the whole world is trying to think about how you get crop fertilization cheaper, quicker, more efficient, and productivity up. So, it's leading that challenge, and of course, the Chinese, with the most amount of people in the world. They are the ones that are likely to be starved or not correctly if they don't control it, so… It's probably that's… it's another big battle. Yeah. So anyway, Gareth's got this role, he starts actually on the 1st of September, because he moves back on Monday, so he's flying in with a whole family and about 15 suitcases, apparently. Because they have to live for the next 2 months until this container comes over with whatever stuff they've got left, and anyway… So, he plans to be there, which is great. It'll be lovely for us, because we'll be able to see him on a more regular basis. So, so that's that, basically. He, he is, he is very well paid, let's put it that way. He's gonna be strapped for cash. Currently, because… He's put one of the children into Mulfsford. Have you heard of Mulford Boys School? I happen to have that. It's just out…. It's just outside Goring, Molford. Okay. And the other one is a, … the next one up, because that's only a prep school, for Isla, their eldest, and they're going to somewhere called Ship Lake. Good lake, yeah. Yeah, so that's where… they will both go there in the end, and as will the third one as well. So it's private school as well, so he was a little bit… when we found out, well, because that's the other thing we've been doing. My feet haven't touched the ground in the last four months. We've been going up there on a regular basis with either him or his wife. Looking at all these hundreds of schools around that area, and then, you know, the following day, looking at loads of properties, and we've been doing that literally every day for I don't know how long, but it's finally all come, and I've said, once he's back on Monday, we're collecting him from the airport without 3 cars. I said, that's it! I'm cutting him off for 3 months. There's none of this. Dad, can you come and help me do this? Dad, can you come and help me do that?" (Page 8-9)
Value: George's wife, Alison, is 70 this year and is still working as a bank nurse, though less frequently. She has a pension pot of approximately £80,000-£90,000 with TPT, but TPT's systems are currently undergoing transfer, causing issues. Alison plans to retire definitely next year when her nursing revalidation (which lasts 2 years, renewed last year) expires. George's son, Gareth, previously worked for Weber Shandwick, a top PR company, and then started his own PR company called Human First after experiencing redundancy. He has now secured a well-paid role as head of AI comms for Syngenta (a Chinese-owned multi-billion pound agriculture company) and is moving back to the UK, starting September 1st. He will be based near Goring, Oxford, renting a 5-bedroom house near the Thames for a year while looking for a permanent home. Gareth is currently moving his family (including 3 children, one named Isla) and possessions from the US, with a container arriving in two months. George has helped him significantly, including lending him £23,000 to buy a car, and is assisting with his relocation and settling into new private schools for his children (Mulford Boys School and Ship Lake). Gareth is looking to transfer his US-based money and pension to the UK and needs financial advice. George also has a daughter, whose children he cannot afford to send to private school if he pays for Gareth's, leading to a "catch-22 situation". George has 5 grandchildren in total.

I think… I looked it up, … I had a, … What's the word I'm looking for? I had a fall on holiday in, in, … In… where was I? I was in Portugal. And, … Bash, bash my head. And everyone thought, you know, I was… I was dying, and my heart was going on something, or blah blah blah, that sort of stuff. They wouldn't let me fly. And, so I stepped down in hospital. And anyway, I came back, and then I went to see the specialist, and, had to do all these tests. And, … Which is quite interesting. Obviously, … Then came back after all the tests, and the guy said, you had your best results you've had the last 4 years. Ugh. So you're no longer diabetic too, you're, … what's he called? I call all those other things, they test. Pretty diabetic. So I'm below pre-diabetic now, so that's interesting. And my blood pressure had gone down quite a lot, and my cholesterol which was… I think it was at 3. is now at 2, and 1.7 is, sort of, Olympic standard. Yeah. So I'm thinking, well, that's interesting. I mean, I had lost 2 stone in the 6 months taking some pills. For the diabet… diabetes and stuff. Which is a bit weird, but anyway. So… they were a bit worried, so I had… I think 3 weeks when I perhaps wasn't, perhaps, at my best. Thinking about all these sort of things. So, I, … I apologize if I didn't, …. Now, I… I… it's not like you, Clive, and I just wondered what was up, because normally you'd get back to me, or say something, or whatever, and it was just, like, all quiet under the Western Front, and I went. Well, I was obviously very… so I don't know whether I missed… I went through a whole checklist, but I mean, luckily it's pretty easy to do now, checking all those things, so I apologize, because I was also slightly confused, because… Your son emailed me. Yes, that's right. So I didn't know… I didn't know what to say to him, what you said to him, so I was a bit like, okay, I better speak to George first, in regards to that. Yeah, no, that's fine. I mean, I think. just… I think he was just introducing himself, Clive. Yeah, but I didn't know whether, that was…. you told him, like, we'll get together, and I was thinking, okay, well, I better have a conversation first, blah blah blah. Yes, no, absolutely. I don't know, I don't know where… don't know where we are. And I think then… then the second time, as soon as I come back, the world seems to sort of explode it into sort of, thought process, and God knows what else has come.

And that's now starting to come to fruition, where, well. do I start spending a lot more of this money, or what can I do? I mean, the big problem is, I mean, we've talked about private schools. He's sending his two, three, to private school. The big problem I have with that, of doing it, then my daughter can't afford to send her children to private school. I can't pay for those two. And then not for the others. So, I'm in a bit of a catch-22 situation. I can't afford to pay 5 of them. Thank you very much. I'm not that wealthy.

Well, I mean, the, the other… going back to the whole commodity thing, the big thing is, is having, food and agriculture, and Syngenta is one of the biggest suppliers of fertilization of crop, so you're… the whole world is trying to think about how you get crop fertilization cheaper, quicker, more efficient, and productivity up. So, it's leading that challenge, and of course, the Chinese, with the most amount of people in the world. They are the ones that are likely to be starved or not correctly if they don't control it, so… It's probably that's… it's another big battle. Yeah. So anyway, Gareth's got this role, he starts actually on the 1st of September, because he moves back on Monday, so he's flying in with a whole family and about 15 suitcases, apparently. Because they have to live for the next 2 months until this container comes over with whatever stuff they've got left, and anyway… So, he plans to be there, which is great. It'll be lovely for us, because we'll be able to see him on a more regular basis. So, so that's that, basically. He, he is, he is very well paid, let's put it that way. He's gonna be strapped for cash. Currently, because… He's put one of the children into Mulfsford. Have you heard of Mulford Boys School? I happen to have that. It's just out…. It's just outside Goring, Molford. Okay. And the other one is a, … the next one up, because that's only a prep school, for Isla, their eldest, and they're going to somewhere called Ship Lake. Good lake, yeah. Yeah, so that's where… they will both go there in the end, and as will the third one as well. So it's private school as well, so he was a little bit… when we found out, well, because that's the other thing we've been doing. My feet haven't touched the ground in the last four months. We've been going up there on a regular basis with either him or his wife. Looking at all these hundreds of schools around that area, and then, you know, the following day, looking at loads of properties, and we've been doing that literally every day for I don't know how long, but it's finally all come, and I've said, once he's back on Monday, we're collecting him from the airport without 3 cars. I said, that's it! I'm cutting him off for 3 months. There's none of this. Dad, can you come and help me do this? Dad, can you come and help me do that?" (Page 8-9)
Value: George Williams is retired. His wife, Alison, aged 70, is a bank nurse but is gradually reducing her working hours and plans to retire next year when her professional revalidation expires. She has a pension pot of £80,000-£90,000 with TPT, but the system is currently experiencing transfer issues. George's son, Gareth, has recently secured a new, very well-paid role as head of AI comms for Syngenta (a Chinese-owned multi-billion pound agriculture company) and is relocating from the US back to the UK, starting September 1st. He will be based in Goring, Oxfordshire, where he is renting a 5-bedroom house. Gareth previously worked for Weber Shandwick, then set up his own PR company, Human First, before joining Syngenta. He has 3 children, including an eldest daughter named Isla, who will attend private schools (Mulford Boys School and Ship Lake). George has been actively assisting Gareth with his move, including lending him £23,000 for a car, and he and Alison have spent four months helping with school and property searches. Gareth is looking for advice on transferring his US investments and pension to the UK to fund a house deposit. George expresses a "catch-22" situation regarding paying private school fees for Gareth's children versus his daughter's children, as he cannot afford to pay for all five grandchildren.

Value: George Williams recently experienced a fall on holiday in Portugal where he hit his head, leading to hospitalization and being unable to fly. He subsequently underwent tests and specialists confirmed he had his best health results in 4 years, is no longer diabetic (now below pre-diabetic), and his blood pressure and cholesterol (from 3 to 2, with 1.7 being Olympic standard) have significantly improved. He lost 2 stone in 6 months due to medication for diabetes. This period caused him to be "not at my best" for about 3 weeks.

Value: George Williams recently experienced a serious illness or accident when he had a fall on holiday in Portugal, hitting his head. This led to hospitalization and being unable to fly. Following extensive tests with specialists, he received excellent health news, being told he had his best results in 4 years. He is no longer diabetic (now below pre-diabetic) and has seen significant improvements in his blood pressure and cholesterol levels, which dropped from 3 to 2 (1.7 is Olympic standard). He attributes a 2-stone weight loss over 6 months to medication for diabetes. This health event resulted in him being "not at my best" for approximately 3 weeks.

Evidence: "No, no, I've got an update on some commercial… I'm, you know, I'm the commercial manager, so I've got a new sponsorship scheme going on. We lost a couple of our sponsors, unfortunately. This year, again, just financial issues while they can't do it. We've been promoting now 4 years on the trot. We've got a. Interesting. Yeah, we've got an amazing setup. We're playing in London leagues now, and it… yeah, we've got… everything's clicked at the right time, right? Captain, right players we've attracted. In the local area, you know, we've beaten all the local sides now, so… you know, we're playing some top-quality sides now, and … sponsorship is just something… I mean, I raise about 20 grand a year. But we had 2 pull out, which meant it dropped down to 14, and I'm trying to get More sponsors back in, and you know what, it's so hard to get people to sponsor these type of clubs at the moment, so… I've been making up a whole load of marketing blurb to send out to people to say, yeah, this is what our bronze package, gold package. a platinum package, and this… what, selling players for the year, you know, you buy a player for the year, 200 quid, and you get your name there, da-da-da-da. So, we're trying to sell to everybody, and the best thing is, in-house, we've got lots of mum and dads from minis and juniors that work for companies, work for businesses, and it's starting to pay off, so it's quite good fun, actually. Well, so who is your… who are you pla… who are the top people in the division you've got now, then? Well, people like Cobham and those…. Yeah, so, yeah, we're playing up. They really are, you really are, you are really playing. Playing it in the big boys league now! And then, so is this going into this season, you're going into that league, or…? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, so it will be, it will be, yeah, we're traveling quite a… a way away, so, you know, but yeah, we'll… we'll see. Sometimes you go, hmm… have we reached the level we want to get to? And that's what worries me. We've done this before, not quite as high as this, but we've done it before, when Gareth was playing, actually, and … we hit that level, and we came down like a… stone. I mean, we just fell and kept falling. Because once you start getting beaten. People go, do you know what? I've had enough of this this season, I'm gonna go off and play for so-and-so. They're an up-and-coming club. Yeah. And all of a sudden, the whole ethos of the club's just… Yeah, yeah. I think changes. And you have to rebuild from grassroots again, so, … Yeah." (Page 24-25)
Value: George Williams is actively involved as the commercial manager for a rugby club, focusing on developing a new sponsorship scheme. He previously raised £20,000 annually but, due to two sponsors pulling out because of financial issues, the amount has dropped to £14,000. He is working to attract more sponsors by creating marketing packages, including bronze, gold, and platinum tiers, and offering options like "selling players" for £200 per year, utilizing connections with parents from the club's minis and juniors sections who work for various companies. The club has seen significant success, promoting for four years consecutively, and is now playing in London leagues against top-quality sides like Cobham, which involves extensive travel. George expresses concern that the club might have reached its peak and could experience a decline, similar to a past situation when his son Gareth played, where a drop in performance led to players leaving and the club having to rebuild from grassroots.

Evidence: "clive.martin: So if we said 85,000, and then we… and then we multiplied, You're… 72? Yeah. Okay, so if we took… if we took, … Sorry, 85,000. And we took 20 years, that takes you to 92. So that gives you a bit more on the upside. … So you need £1.7 million worth of assets. A big cup. about it. Over that 20 years. Yeah. Now… … This is why you need to have a sort of chew over in your own mind, you think whether this sort of makes sense. So, 85,000, … … Divided by 2 sixths. So if you took $85,000 out, that's about 3.2% of your pot. Right, okay. So, if you're looking at… So, we work on a figure that, if you're talking about an income, if you look at a 4% figure. Has been conservative long-term asset returns of assets, and if we're in a balanced portfolio, we're trying to make 5, so there's another better than 1% buffer in regards to that. So you're below the 4%, so… As a starting point. That would mean if you took that $85,000 out. Each year, and we made 4%. You'd have all that money still there, plus a bit more. In 20 years' time." (Page 16-17)
Value: Based on an annual income requirement of £85,000, and George's current age of 72, the scenario assumes planning for 20 years, taking him to age 92. This would require £1.7 million in assets to cover the income. The calculation uses a conservative long-term asset return figure of 4%. Taking £85,000 out annually represents about 3.2% of George's current investment pot, which is below the assumed 4% return, indicating that the capital would remain intact or grow over 20 years.

Evidence: "George Williams: Yeah. Does that seem fair?" (Page 16), "George Williams: Yeah, I think you always said that when we first started this conversation off some 15, 20 years ago, about how much I'd have left when we, you know, if you carried on taking this amount. George Williams: And even now, I still look at the pension pot, and I go, it's exactly the same as it was, like. George Williams: 10 years ago, 1.3 million, or 1.2 million. It's exactly the same." (Page 17), "clive.martin: You've still got, in our view, 900,000 above the level you think you probably need." (Page 17), "George Williams: Yes. Now, there's no silver bullet. There's a lot of… there's lots of things you can do that all add up. If that makes sense. Okay, yes, it does, yeah." (Page 17), "George Williams: It is something that we're really thinking about now, Clive, and I think those type of things, we need to start putting into place. I think financially, I'm okay, because we're not massive, great big spenders. I'm not going to go out and buy a Porsche tomorrow, as you know, you've known me too long now, you know. Yeah, we want to take some more holidays. And yeah, I might be spending another extra 10, or maybe even 20 grand a year on some holidays, but that certainly is not going to break the bank or really affect what we're doing here, I don't think, in any way." (Page 24)
Value: George agrees that £85,000 per year for living expenses is a fair estimate. He notes that his pension pot has remained stable at £1.2-£1.3 million over the past 10 years despite withdrawals, which aligns with previous discussions about capital longevity. He acknowledges a surplus of £900,000 above the projected £1.7 million needed for 20 years of income. George is open to various strategies for Inheritance Tax (IHT) mitigation, understanding that multiple approaches will be needed. He confirms he is financially comfortable and not a large spender, and that increased holiday spending (£10,000-£20,000 extra per year) would not significantly impact his overall financial plan.

Evidence: "George Williams: 10 years ago, I suppose, when I retired, actually. So we've been… I don't know how much we took out of it, and how much I had at that point, but, but…. clive.martin: Just remember, we just did the personal allowance bit, in regards to that, so I can certainly find that out for you, that's no problem. Okay. So, so, so… I think maybe what, … unless you say otherwise, I think it'd be useful to see whether you need any more money income starting from next year, in terms of a tax point of view, if you're going to get some money back from your son and so forth. But, we can change… we can change the income at any point, as you know. So, you know, if you think you need some more, then that's… that's a… That's a… that's a separate issue, but…. a separate issue. It's not at the moment. My, yeah, my current account is going down slowly, and I'm… I tend not to use it now for, oh, you know what, we'll book that holiday for a couple of grand and go away, and I just use it out of my current account. I don't take it out of my current account, I take it out of my savings accounts, you know, wherever I've got that money, and it's just easy to do that I've got. No, no, no, I get it, I get it. I mean, look, I think, I think the, the, the challenge… oh, one thing. What would you say the value of the property's worth now? I would say about a million. Okay. around a million, Clyde, something like that. And that's the other problem, you know, yeah, yeah, it is. So, so, look, … If we take the inheritance tax scenario. just where we are today. You… 2.8 or 2.6? I can't… I can't read my own writing in terms of your… what the total amount you've got with us. … So, if I… My total investments, you're right, well, if we take everything from the investments that I've got, like, everywhere. That's my cash, and also the cash that you have. That's about $2.7 million. The house is worth a million, and that gives me a total worth at the moment, I reckon, of $3.7 million. Correct, yep, that's roughly. So you knock off $650,000. Because that's your new rate band. Roy. You understand what Neil White Bond is? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, so times that by 40%. So at the moment, you're looking at a 1.2 million pound bill. Yeah, I know. Jesus. So… Don't, don't panic, Mr Mallon. I'm panicked! So I think, I think there are… there are… There are 3 things I'm getting clients to think about. Well, let's go back and stage. what is your view about that? Is it A, I don't give a monkeys that someone else's problems. B, … I am worried about that, but I'm also worried about my own expenditure. Or C, no, I want to make sure that the government gets as little money as possible. I think I tend to go on C, really. That's… you know, I don't want the government to get my money, but there again, you know… We haven't got a massive… expenditure wish list, or whatever. That hasn't changed. So, yes, I want to spend more on the money that I've got now. I'd like to get it to my children now, if I could. In some method, to make sure we have enough money. So, the things that I always think, I'm going to get to a stage Maybe, maybe not, I don't know. Let's say… in another 15 years' time, or wherever 20 years' time, where I'm going, well, Mum and Dad, you've got to go into a home. You know, the cost of that is, I've always said, the million pounds in the house will cover that, I would think. I would hope it would, because the average life span of someone going into a home, I know, is… is less than 4 years. It is. So, you know, I've calculated that out and got, well, that… that will cover us for a home for that period. So the money. So that then leaves about, you know, two… two… two… 2.7 million to get rid of, somehow. Without the taxman getting hold of it. Per se. Now, it might be that I pop my clogs next year, and Alison does as well, or whatever. … Cool. You don't know, you can't…. you need a crystal ball, and I'm not sure if anyone's got any one of those. But I would like to… if there was a way of being able to say, actually, I could do… you know, you read about these trusts or stuff, and then you're the people that are being caught by them, or whatever, or leaving your house in a deed for someone else, and the children get caught with a tax implication, as we did with Alison's mothers. et cetera, et cetera. Well, I'd like to find… I know that I can give the money to the kids at the moment, and I do, and point of fact, I give more than, I think, seven grand or whatever it is at the moment to them. But my view is they're such small amounts that, you know, no one declares it, and I don't think anyone can find out, really, unless the taxman comes along and says, oh, let's have a look at his account. Well, my ears are slightly shutting at those comments, but, so…. I know. Let's be black and white, but the, … a pet is basically you should live 7 years, so you live 7 years in regards to that. And if… if in the event that, on your death, that the HMRC are worried about it, they can go back into your situation, and then they can… they can dig everything up. Yeah. So, … I will perhaps send you a form that you can look at if you want to record this on a regular basis, because I'll show you. If you've got income versus expenditure rules, where you've got more income than expenditure, you can gift that money out on a monthly basis, or over the year, and that is automatically outside your estate. But you need to record it, because if someone comes back in and says. You know. what the hell was that? Then you need to prove it, otherwise it'll go back into the estate, and you might get, you know. But also from the point of view, if you don't live the 7 years. So, one should be, right now, more… Than ever, to be clear, because they'll have the ability to check the accounts. So, that's one. I think one of the, … There's some simple stuff. that I think people should consider. But before, before I do that, what do you think your general expenditure is, then? If you're being conservative and say, well, I want to have a certain amount of income to enjoy, what do you reckon the number is, in terms of your point of view? I don't know, actually, to be honest. What would you say you're spending now? You said Alison's spending about 1500 quid a month. And you're spending about, …. Yeah, I mean…. Well, you must be spending roughly about 50, aren't you? Yes. I was gonna say 50. I would think, between us. We've got an annual expenditure of between… Yeah, 60 to 70, I would think, with the other bits and pieces. But then, on top of that, you know, we draw down maybe 10, 15K for holidays or other bits and pieces like that, new, whatever. No, no, so, so, so, … I was ver… so, I would… I would think that, basically, you should probably be thinking about $85,000 a year, which is $70,000, what I call day-to-day expenditures, and gives you 15 grand for a float for holidays and stuff like that. Yeah. Does that seem fair? Yeah. So then… and then you get into the sort of more brutal camp thought process. Well, how long am I going to live for? Right? I know. And if you take the normal average, so you might, you might, as one client said to me, I'm way above average, I'm going to live way, way beyond the average. I said, fine, then you should plan on that basis, but as a starting point. So, … Married men are 86, and married women are 89 at the moment, roughly, according to the statistics. Really? Yeah, as a… as a… as a number. It's only an average, so, you know, obviously some people, you know, we've got the woman who's living, who's 116 today, so, you know, there's quite a… quite a wide scope. But clearly, part of that is that data includes COVID, and obviously a lot of people died in COVID. So, you know, so that has an impact, but… So, if you took whatever figure we worked on. So if we said 85,000, and then we… and then we multiplied, You're… 72? Yeah. Okay, so if we took… if we took, … Sorry, 85,000. And we took 20 years, that takes you to 92. So that gives you a bit more on the upside. … So you need £1.7 million worth of assets. A big cup. about it. Over that 20 years. Yeah. Now… … This is why you need to have a sort of chew over in your own mind, you think whether this sort of makes sense. So, 85,000, … … Divided by 2 sixths. So if you took $85,000 out, that's about 3.2% of your pot. Right, okay. So, if you're looking at… So, we work on a figure that, if you're talking about an income, if you look at a 4% figure. Has been conservative long-term asset returns of assets, and if we're in a balanced portfolio, we're trying to make 5, so there's another better than 1% buffer in regards to that. So you're below the 4%, so… As a starting point. That would mean if you took that $85,000 out. Each year, and we made 4%. You'd have all that money still there, plus a bit more. In 20 years' time. Yeah, I think you always said that when we first started this conversation off some 15, 20 years ago, about how much I'd have left when we, you know, if you carried on taking this amount. George Williams: And even now, I still look at the pension pot, and I go, it's exactly the same as it was, like. George Williams: 10 years ago, 1.3 million, or 1.2 million. It's exactly the same. So, so… What that basically says is there's probably a bit of… there's a bit of, freedom in terms of stuff that even if you… as you know. you spend more money in the first 10, 10, 15 years, it then flattens out, and then it starts coming down. So the reality is, if you're building a buffer, you're probably not going to be spending that in 5-10 years' time. Yeah, yeah. … And don't forget, obviously, you review each year anyway, so, but on the basis of that. And you've already got to… so… You've still got, in our view, 900,000 above the level you think you probably need. Yeah. But… That's just the start… this is what… this is what I mean about… this is just a starting figure. Now, the question is, is that still there? Paying $1.2 million. Of the whole thing. So if you did nothing, and it carried on growing in another 20 years. The likelihood is that that bill's likely to go up slightly over time. Because your other assets will have gone up as well, so, … The bill's likely to get bigger. So, I would say to clients. if you're comfortable with your number being good, and, you know, $85,000 as a starting point, I think is a reasonable go at it. That's not say you can't change your mind at any point, by the way, you're not locked into the 20 years, you can only take 85 grand back, and that would be silly."

You know, like, she hasn't worked for the last 2 months. I think she's got a couple of shifts booked next month. But she is still working. I tried to find out her pension pot the other day. Yep. And TPT, who it's with, have you heard of TPT? Can't they have TPT? They are… what's that stand for? I don't know. But anyway, their systems are being…. being transferred for the last 3 months, it's just been a nightmare. So many complaints about it. Anyway, anyway, it's done, and they finally did it, and I looked through, and she's got a healthy pot in there now of, like, I'm sure it's something like about 80 or 90,000 she's got in. So, I mean, we've always said, because she gets such good returns from her working and. No, no, no, no. contribution. Absolutely. But, I mean, it's getting to the stage now where she's saying… I mean, she's 70 this year. Well, I mean, I mean, I… I…. Yeah. I admire her, but she obviously still enjoys doing what she's doing, so, you know, if she still enjoys it, then who am I to say you don't know what you're doing? 100%, and that's what I say, you know. need to do it. You don't need to go to work. We're not, we're not, you know, need the money. Rap for cash. Yeah, I said, we don't need the money. I said, at the moment, I said I want to try and spend as much money as I can, and I bloody, you know, Labour government bloody didn't get hold of it, but, you know, that… I think we've always said about financial planning for the long term. And that's now starting to come to fruition, where, well. do I start spending a lot more of this money, or what can I do?" (Page 12)
Value: George Williams, aged 72, is retired. His wife, Alison, aged 70, is a bank nurse but plans to retire definitively next year, likely by the end of the tax year, when her 2-year revalidation period ends. Alison's pension pot with TPT is valued at £80,000-£90,000, though TPT's systems are currently experiencing transfer issues. George and Alison's combined annual income requirement for retirement is estimated at £85,000, comprising £70,000 for day-to-day expenses and a £15,000 float for holidays and discretionary spending. Based on George's age and average life expectancies (86 for married men, 89 for married women), planning for 20 years (until age 92) would require £1.7 million in assets to cover this income. George's total investments of £2.7 million (excluding his £1 million home) are sufficient, as the £85,000 annual withdrawal represents only 3.2% of his pot, well below the conservative 4% long-term asset return target, ensuring capital longevity. George notes his pension pot (currently £1.2-£1.3 million) has remained stable over the past 10 years despite withdrawals. He acknowledges a £900,000 surplus above his estimated long-term income needs. George is considering increasing his discretionary spending, including an additional £10,000-£20,000 annually on holidays, and has substantial cash reserves (£130,000) to support this. He will review their income needs for next year after Alison retires.

field_name : **Expenditure Soft Notes**
Evidence: "George Williams: Yeah, I mean…. Well, you must be spending roughly about 50, aren't you? Yes. I was gonna say 50. I would think, between us. We've got an annual expenditure of between… Yeah, 60 to 70, I would think, with the other bits and pieces. But then, on top of that, you know, we draw down maybe 10, 15K for holidays or other bits and pieces like that, new, whatever. No, no, so, so, so, … I was ver… so, I would… I would think that, basically, you should probably be thinking about $85,000 a year, which is $70,000, what I call day-to-day expenditures, and gives you 15 grand for a float for holidays and stuff like that. Yeah. Does that seem fair? Yeah. So then… and then you get into the sort of more brutal camp thought process. Well, how long am I going to live for? Right? I know. And if you take the normal average, so you might, you might, as one client said to me, I'm way above average, I'm going to live way, way beyond the average. I said, fine, then you should plan on that basis, but as a starting point. So, … Married men are 86, and married women are 89 at the moment, roughly, according to the statistics. Really? Yeah, as a… as a… as a number. It's only an average, so, you know, obviously some people, you know, we've got the woman who's living, who's 116 today, so, you know, there's quite a… quite a wide scope. But clearly, part of that is that data includes COVID, and obviously a lot of people died in COVID. So, you know, so that has an impact, but… So, if you took whatever figure we worked on. So if we said 85,000, and then we… and then we multiplied, You're… 72? Yeah. Okay, so if we took… if we took, … Sorry, 85,000. And we took 20 years, that takes you to 92. So that gives you a bit more on the upside. … So you need £1.7 million worth of assets. A big cup. about it. Over that 20 years. Yeah. Now… … This is why you need to have a sort of chew over in your own mind, you think whether this sort of makes sense. So, 85,000, … … Divided by 2 sixths. So if you took $85,000 out, that's about 3.2% of your pot. Right, okay. So, if you're looking at… So, we work on a figure that, if you're talking about an income, if you look at a 4% figure. Has been conservative long-term asset returns of assets, and if we're in a balanced portfolio, we're trying to make 5, so there's another better than 1% buffer in regards to that. So you're below the 4%, so… As a starting point. That would mean if you took that $85,000 out. Each year, and we made 4%. You'd have all that money still there, plus a bit more. In 20 years' time. Yeah, I think you always said that when we first started this conversation off some 15, 20 years ago, about how much I'd have left when we, you know, if you carried on taking this amount. George Williams: And even now, I still look at the pension pot, and I go, it's exactly the same as it was, like. George Williams: 10 years ago, 1.3 million, or 1.2 million. It's exactly the same. So, so… What that basically says is there's probably a bit of… there's a bit of, freedom in terms of stuff that even if you… as you know. you spend more money in the first 10, 10, 15 years, it then flattens out, and then it starts coming down. So the reality is, if you're building a buffer, you're probably not going to be spending that in 5-10 years' time. Yeah, yeah. … And don't forget, obviously, you review each year anyway, so, but on the basis of that. And you've already got to… so… You've still got, in our view, 900,000 above the level you think you probably need. Yeah. But… That's just the start… this is what… this is what I mean about… this is just a starting figure. Now, the question is, is that still there? Paying $1.2 million. Of the whole thing. So if you did nothing, and it carried on growing in another 20 years. The likelihood is that that bill's likely to go up slightly over time. Because your other assets will have gone up as well, so, … The bill's likely to get bigger. So, I would say to clients. if you're comfortable with your number being good, and, you know, $85,000 as a starting point, I think is a reasonable go at it. That's not say you can't change your mind at any point, by the way, you're not locked into the 20 years, you can only take 85 grand back, and that would be silly." (Page 14-17), "George Williams: It's just started to going, oh, my bank balance is a bit low, … I'm… I'll top it up from some of my other ones. Oh, we need to go on holiday. Oh, I'll take that out of my invest tech. Because what I've always been trying to do, as you know, Clive, is to clear out all of my other odds. Have you got one of your famous spreadsheets that you can send me again to give me an update in terms of that? No. No. Yeah, I'll send it over to you. What's your cash reserve at the moment, just roughly, as it were? Roughly, rough… oh god, I haven't even got a clue, but I can. within a click of a button. I'm going to test your great systems, I know they all do. The thing is that it is, … no, no. It is quite a bit down at the moment, only because I've lent Gareth about $23,000 to buy this car. So…. What is that for? Yeah, absolutely. So… that I would say… investments, here we go, sorry. Investments in June, doom-dum-dum… So, GIAs are… like, sand down there, here we go. So, I would say, in total, I've got… Where's that come from? No. Total cash, 143,000. No, that's not right. 31… 9, 40, 40, 70… yeah, it is. It's about 130,000, I would say, Clive. Okay, fine. So, that's… that's… that's… that's plenty cash reserve, cash, cash reserve, as… as… as I would say, unless you're telling me otherwise. No, no, it's absolutely superb at the moment, because what I… what I tend to do is, like, I took the family away on holiday, you know, spent 20 grand at the beginning of the year. I'm thinking about… my car's 6 years old, and I'm thinking about getting a new car. … Not an electric one. So yes, I'm thinking about it, but at the moment, that… those type of things, those extra… if you like, spend, I'm doing. I have noticed that, you know, again, my, … my day-to-day costs, as everything, has just gone up. Yeah. So, yeah, I mean, if you remember, I did take it down during COVID, because we just weren't spending any money at all, and I thought, what's the point of it getting paid it? I don't need it. Yep. It then went up again. And I'm not sure where I am on my… that was the other question I wanted to ask, where I am on my tax-free amount of pension." (Page 14), "George Williams: Yeah, we want to take some more holidays. And yeah, I might be spending another extra 10, or maybe even 20 grand a year on some holidays" (Page 24)
Value: George Williams and Alison have an estimated annual expenditure of £85,000, which includes £70,000 for day-to-day costs and a £15,000 float for holidays. George recently spent £20,000 on a family holiday at the beginning of the year and is considering purchasing a new car, as his current one is 6 years old. He notes that his day-to-day costs have generally increased. His current account balance is slowly diminishing, but he can replenish it from his savings. He has lent his son Gareth £23,000 for a car, which temporarily reduced his cash reserves. George currently has approximately £130,000 in cash. He mentions reducing his pension drawdown during COVID due to reduced spending. He is now open to spending an additional £10,000 to £20,000 per year on holidays, believing this will not significantly impact his overall financial plan.

Evidence: "clive.martin: Well, I'll add them along. But in essence, and it was typical, because basically the price didn't move, and of course the market went up the week that it did it. So. So I was hoping in my… and as I said to them, well, if it goes back on, then it's gone up, everyone's fund's gone up by 1%, they won't care. No. But if they've gone down by 5%, then that might be a bit of a different issue." (Page 3), "George Williams: Yeah, I mean, for people like myself, it doesn't really matter, because, you know, I turn… I go on there maybe once a month and look at, where are we now? Oh, that's good, you know, it's gone up by that much, or it's gone down by that much. So, it doesn't really worry me that much, but I can imagine there must be a lot of people out there that actually manage their portfolio a lot closer than, sort of. Well, I mean, to be honest, we're… I mean, we don't have many clients who do that. Right, okay. Well… simply because…. the whole purpose of coming to someone like ourselves is that…. So, if, you know, ultimately, at the end of the day, if you can see what it's doing all the time, if you want to, that's what a lot of people want to be able to switch on. Two, if there's an issue in regards to performance, then obviously there's someone to talk to in regards to that, and blah blah blah, and of course, we've got all the stuff, you know. You probably, you know, I don't know, don't know how you feel, but, … we over-egg information. We've got all that information on the portal, we've got, you know, the quarterly reports. I mean, there is no way people don't know how it's doing, good or bad. Right. So, you know, in some respects, that hopefully is calming. We think that's a calming effect over time. And if, I mean, go back to COVID… You know, we wrote a letter every month to say it has to get it's gone down by a bit more, blah blah blah, but… Interestingly enough, the best feedback we ever got Was that people thought. Well, they're just telling me all the time, and people are saying, well, no one else is writing to me. It's like, why aren't they writing to me? And… and you guys at Salted are, like, churning out paperwork every week. That's right. We, we think, we think it's a good idea, but look, it, it, … in the modern world, as you, you know, when everything… everyone says, well, you should go digital, young man, you know, everything, you know, and speed of… of information is, you know, everyone wants it faster and faster. Well. Trouble is, if someone cuts it off, or whatever, then it does have a slight problem. It has… it has a… and I mean, yeah, I mean, I was in it, as you know, for years, and it is… from what I can see now, it's getting more dangerous with AI and with what's happening in the marketplace, how people are going to actually secure their data. from certain elements of, scammers and whatever, I just find it ridiculous. You know, sometimes you go back to the old days, you had POW notes, and unless you were robbed, that was it. Your money was safe. Unfortunately, nowadays, it's just all up there in the cloud. And people get access to it. I don't care how good some of these people are, there's a better hacker somewhere that will get through the firewall, that will get through somewhere. It's… it's quite worrying." (Page 3-4), "George Williams: It's still the same bloody price, which would be rather ironic, but there we go. That is quite good. I mean, I did have a quick review of the market, of the platform. Obviously, it's not completely up-to-date, but… George Williams: I mean, in the last year, the market, and my money, seems to have gone up a flying rate. It's… the market's done very well, considering the state of the economy and labor and everything else at the moment. Well, I think, I think, if… if I was being, comp… One of the… Challenges going forward in the next decade. Is… is actually trying to work out How you get diversity. You know, because… If you're having, you know. They're equities, but equities in general, I mean, yes, they're gross equities, and yes, there's some conservative equities, but if there's a crash, they all go down. It's a question about how much they go down by. Yeah. You know, the bond market is all taken into interest rates and inflation, so, you know. In general, most bomb markets around the world behave the same. I mean, they're probably not so much at the moment, but you probably know what they're going to do. So to try and get a different slant on things is quite tricky. If you, if you, if you have a… So… So I'm the commodity buff on the IM committee, so on the asset, so we've had our highest commodity exposure of all time. Really? So, and at the moment, that commodity exposure has been gold and silver. So, if you… if you think about an average benchmark. Yes. Most people have 0% in gold and silver. Okay. So, we have had approximately ranging between 4% to 10% in the gold and silver market in the last 3 years in the portfolio. And, gold's up 100%. So, is it…. Really? Yep. And gold has outperformed the S&P. It's up 28% this year, and silver's up about 30%. So unless you know about these things. Yeah. You don't notice it, because no one has it. So you're a bit like the wolf, all on your own in the corner. the only time you notice it, if you have a big position in these, what I call… Slightly different vehicles. It only matters if it basically goes the opposite way, because your diversification doesn't work. Right, okay, yeah, I'm good. … But we do think… that commodities are in a bull market for the next decade. Oh, good. Now… The trouble about… the trouble about commodities… and much as I love commodities, they're smaller markets, they move quicker, and they're very volatile, both up and down. So, yeah. You have to be careful about sizing the position. That makes sense. Yes, but no…. 100%, I understand, yeah, yeah. And also how you trade them, because, … It's… it's difficult, … so you can have stop losses in… to a certain extent, in… in… a portfolio. So if you had, you know, a massive amount of Apple shares, and you wanted to cut the position if it went through 220p, you could basically put a stop loss in there, and it all gets automatically sold. It's a bit harder to do that in the In the commodity market. So, we are very, very diversified, for a number of reasons. One is that, In general terms, the things that are… big capacity. AI build data centers. EVs. You need a hell of a lot of copper. Yes, no, you're right, it is. It's…. And a lot of precious metals as well. So it takes about 10 years to… to find and build a… So you can't just turn the tattles, or I'd like to… I'd like to increase my copper, production by 300%, please. It's not possible. It doesn't happen. And of course, the speed at which the EV market and those sort of things is adoption. You know, everyone… everyone knows it's going to get to there at some point, but no one knows the, you know, how it gets there. So, Norway, for example, is now, this year, 100% of its car sales are EVs. Really? Now, that's… that's quite weird. you know, say that in the UK, and then we'll go, well… The only thing I want an EV car, because I'm not convinced I can fill it up further, how many out? You know, so that they're all… they're all going half what typical UK Conservative They're in the hybrid market. That's what's going on at the moment. Hybrid market is booming, electrical market is down by something like 50% of what they predicted, or less. So, so… Each country has its own things, but it's all to do with the infrastructure. Yeah. Because if you had, … If everyone could have an EV car and you could, you know. Plug it into your own home, and you all had solar panels. you know, you'll be… you'll be kids in. But of course, How long that's gonna take. I think, though, Clive, yes, I agree with all that, but one of the biggest things that people are thinking about, and the conversation I'm having with people that are having exactly the same conversations as to why they don't want to buy an EV car. It's simply reason, is that the batteries are not there yet, and that a car A, you have to pay more for an EV car at the moment. And B. literally, you drive it off the forecourt, and the price of it drops through the bottom, because after about 5 or 6 years, you won't be able to sell it, because people will go, well, I've only got about another 4 years' life out of it. Now, that is changing. But at the moment, the batteries are going, you know, they're… you know, after 10 years, you have to spend, like, thousands on new batteries. And at the moment, it does not make sense to buy an EV car. I understand that logic. … It. It's pretty clear that If you're in the short journey world. Yeah. then the EV is, like, because you save however much you save in terms of petrol and all those other stuff, so… so I think… 30-mile radius, if you're in and out of the, you know, it's quits in. As soon as you get past regular 50 mile… 50 miles every day type thing. I… I understand that. … … the speed at which these things happen. So, … But the, … so… copper, gold, silver. Silver has been… this is going to be the fifth year of, decrease in terms of, production versus demand, so you, you know… Wow. So… And if you look at the subsection of all those Those little macro fights that are going on. Yeah, you know. People… people… Why… why is Trump wanting to get on with Ukraine is because it's got minerals. Very many precious minerals there that he's already signing that agreement with them for. why is he… why does he not want to kill, China? Because they are the largest producers of those sort of things. So he doesn't want to be cut short, he wants to buy some time to basically stop producing and all that sort of stuff. Yeah. So it's clear that we are in an economic war already. Oh, gosh, massive, yeah. So, … Having those sort of stuff, and then if you run out, you can't… if you run out, you can't grow. None. And then you think of all the other stuff that buys with it. With the platforms and stuff. And, … I was, I was, … what was the word I'd use? People were slightly gobsmacked when I said to them. … I'm now in my 60s, and this is the first time I can genuinely ask the question, is USA a capitalist country, or has it become a communist and left-wing party? And my reason and rationale for that is, first time ever. There's a company called MD Materials, which is basically the only mineral company in the US, based in Las Vegas. Oh, right. And, … rather interesting, slow little headlines that never really got into the UK press, but obviously I'm a bit of a commodity nerd. The US government invested $400 million In… in shares in the company. Wow. The following week, Apple Bought 500 million pounds worth of stock as well, because they want guaranteed supply for some of the minerals that they want for their phones. Yeah? So… Did the government and Apple come to a nice little negotiation that basically has meant that that company has got the cap that needs to expand, and oh, and oh, and shit, oh, the share price went up 300% this year. Oh, that's interesting. Well, yeah. It is. They don't care, as long as they're getting the stuff. Yeah. That's the message that I'm getting. Yeah. And therefore, they don't, you know, don't worry about rules about, you know, shares and, you know, all that sort of stuff, so it's very, very… and of course. this week. I'm doing something about Intel. That's the… over the… whatever the… whatever the acts that Biden did. 400 million, or whatever, no, it was a bit more than that, actually. And, they're saying, oh, no, we're not gonna… we're gonna buy… we're gonna buy… we're gonna have to buy some equities in Intel, and the profit is gonna go back to the US, … Just, … … In a central place where we'd keep all the money. So they're now… so now they're… now they're giving money, but they're taking the profit and giving it back. It's like, hello? That's communist behavior. Yeah, it is. Well… Because if you said Donald Trump was a communist, you'd probably get a rather interesting hearing in the US. You would. Yeah, you have to… well, that's the problem with everything now, you have to be so careful what you say. You can't say a word out of place anywhere, otherwise to do good is it gonna fall on you like a ton of bloody… Bricks. So, the world is definitely changing. And therefore, just going back to diversification, you have to… … decide on what diversification, how those diversification cases, you know. So, … You've got that weird thing with… European defense stocks. Now, for the first time, Europe is basically coughing up and going to spend some money, and they're up 150-200% this year. Because finally, Well, I mean, they've… they… not… they've not wanted to do all that sort of stuff. Now they've got no choice but cough up and pay for the defense of… against Russia. Yeah…. Yeah. So, part of the reason and rationale is that having that… But… There are still lots of people who get very scared. When they go climbing. This is so off-piste. our allocation in that area. I said, Well… To be honest, we've been underweight. And they look at me and go, what do you mean they were underweight? Well… It doesn't happen very often. So if you're in a cyclical bull market for commodities, then… If you're not in it, you… they get… they will go up 300%. And I said to him, you look at the last disaster. That people forget about. Do you remember crude oil, what crude oil got to in, in, in COVID? Yes. It got to minus 10. It was… yeah. So, basically. The world's dead, we don't need any oil, we're getting rid of it. We're gonna give it away. I know, it's weird, isn't it? It's just…. And it went from minus 10… 280. So I said… so I said to them, so what return am I getting? And some bright sparks that we can't work that out, because if you start with a minus, it never works out. I said, okay, we'll just deal… deal with naught then. So…. So these things are… But you… you've got to be… you've got to be in it to win it, as they say. So, it's… It's a fascinating time in the world, it's not… I don't think it's going to carry on being… being like that, but… but… but… In the sense that… We think it's going to be easier and I say this with trepidation, looking at your face, it's easier to make an okay return You know, in the 5% campaign. Then trying to make a lot of money, because you'd have to be… Either lucky, or you get your timing right in some of that stuff. You know, uranium's up 85% this year. Yeah. … Who, who would say you'd have uranium in your portfolio? … Or, or nuclear energy. You know, if nuclear energy comes back. which it… which it probably will do as part of the whole thing, then that's gonna be. And then… We've actually got some carbon in our… in our portfolio. Carbon permits, I mean…. Really? That's really, you know, I mean, it's 0.5% of the portfolio. But if you said that to someone and went, oh, I've got carbon in my portfolio, they go, what the fuck do you want that for? Why? What? And then, we will, at some point. Be able to have some… Bitcoin and all that sort of stuff, long and short, hopefully. Yeah. Yeah. There's lots of little divers… so the world's… … In terms of that, but the most important thing is the clients are getting the returns they're expecting, and they're doing the things that they want to do with their money. That's… that's the way we always think about this stuff. Yeah. But at the same time, we've got a very big position, some very low-risk stuff, like… Two, two, two-year bonds. And they're giving us, you know, 4% with no risk, unless the US government goes bust. Yeah, yeah. I mean…. Yeah, I mean, it's funny enough, this week, all I've had is letters from Chantendere, Halifax, I mean, I haven't got lots of money with them or anything, just saying, you know, please note our interest rates have gone down. George Williams: And they're going down, seems like, everywhere at the moment. Yeah. So, I mean, I think the best I've got at the moment is 3.6 from Investec. George Williams: Which I think is still pretty good, actually. …. So, so… I think I've told you before about raisin. Yes. Yeah. Well, if you looked on Raisin, if you've got your iPad there. Yeah. Go on. Look under it now, Raisin, and look under flexible accounts. I think you'll find that some… still some good rates available, and you can still get some good fixed rates as well. Really. It's really annoying, actually, because… For some reason, the rugby club… I'm not in the finances side, but the rugby club had 14 grand, which it said, … well, it's just sitting in an account, this was last year, so we'll invest it in a bond, and I didn't look at it. And they got the results back, and it was something like, you know, 2.5% from a fixed bond. And I went, hang on a minute, you surely must have done better than that. And they just reinvested it again at about the same rate. And I said, well, I know you can get a lot better rate of interest from a lot of other companies on things like that, so I don't know who he was using or why he was using them. … Yeah, I mean… Hash management is also going to be quite important, I think, going forward. The big banks are basically cleaning up. They're just slashing rates. And they're making on the arbitrage, but some of these newer ones, where am I? Savings accounts. Yeah, 4.29% Aldermere. 4.28. 4.26… You get some good rates, can't you? I've never heard of any of those, but there you go! So, so, so that's the first thing that most clients talk to me about. And by the way, this is not a Saltous recommendation, this is just a Clyde Martin thing, you should have a look at it. Blade Martin. You should have started your own business up, Clive. Well, plenty should say that, no, no, I'm joking. But, … the reason why I like it as… to suggest, have a look. You can't get… you can't buy more than the maximum amount under the FSA in one account, so if the maximum's $85,000, You can put no more than $85,000 in that account if you're doing a 1-year fixed bond, or a 3-year fixed bond, or whatever. So, in other words, you can't… the money can't be lost under the FSA compensation scheme. Does that make sense? Right, yeah. Is it 85,000 now? It is £85,000. Yeah, sorry, you're looking at me, and I was thinking, yes. So, so the fixed rate… Yes. So, so…. They all say they're FCS protected, so…. So, so… Some of the banks, you may not, sort of, have a, sort of, penchance for, like, … Alryan Bank, you can guess where that's probably coming from. But… But they all have to apply to the FCA scenario. So, It's 85,000, it says here, yeah, max 85. So, all of them… They can't get on, so… From that point of view, if they go bust, Yes, Greg. So… … So, it means when you've got your millions, George, sort of floating around your cash bank, you'll have to give a lot of $85,000s. That's the only problem. Yeah, that is very true, isn't it? You'd have to invest in quite a lot. But, but, even on the easy access. The top easy access on that is 4.26 with a company called Shawbrook. Right. … So, all I'm saying is, I mean, some of these rates are coming down, but… Yeah. These are the most attractive in the market, because they're just trying to get the money in, They've got a loan book and they want to fill it up. Yeah. No, no, no, absolutely. So, I mean, I think… I think last year, my portfolio in a year, when I looked at it this morning, I think in a year was around 7.6%. Your portfolio with us? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's about… sounds about right. That sounds about right. Yeah. And… and obviously, if you go at 7%, that compounds at, that doubles over 10 years. Yeah, I mean, even… I mean, I think over something like… I think I looked at 3-year one, was the other one, and that was… I was quite gobsmacked by that, it was 21%. Yeah. Over 3 years, which, you know, in…. Which includes one of the worst years ever. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, it's like, yeah. So, I think since… since COVID, near enough, we've really, sort of, come out of the… Thank you. COVID is… from COVID to now, it's been our best five years ever. Yeah. Yeah, I haven't looked… I didn't look at 5 years, but I looked at 3. Well, if you remember COVID 2000 and 2000, it went down 36% in 6 weeks. I know. I know! Look at it, then. I knew what it was going to be like, so I don't… I don't like inflicting pain on myself. You know, I'm one of these people that goes, can I do anything about that? No, I can't. Well, I could have done. I could have said, sell everything up now. I don't want to lose any more money. But at the end of the day, you will… it will go… it goes back. When it goes down, it always comes back. I mean, I've got a very simple philosophy about these things, you know, you can't… You can't do anything about it, so you just get on with your life, and it is what it is." (Page 5-18), "George Williams: So, GIAs are… like, sand down there, here we go. So, I would say, in total, I've got… Where's that come from? No. Total cash, 143,000. No, that's not right. 31… 9, 40, 40, 70… yeah, it is. It's about 130,000, I would say, Clive." (Page 14), "George Williams: So, he invested $80,000…. Yep. in March 2018, And I think that was split between myself and Alison's account. Okay. And then he invested a further $19,000. George Williams: on the 8th of April, 2021. Okay, so we've got $80,000 for 7 years, and we've got $19,000 for 4 years." (Page 11)
Value: George Williams's total investments (including cash) are approximately £2.7 million. His portfolio with Saltus has shown strong performance, with a 7.6% return over the last year and 21% over the last 3 years, which notably included one of the worst years ever during COVID. Clive states that the period from COVID to now has been their best five years ever. The portfolio is diversified, with a historical high commodity exposure, including gold and silver, which have been in a bull market for the last decade. Gold is up 100% over the last 3 years and 28% this year, outperforming the S&P, while silver is up about 30%. The portfolio also includes 0.5% in carbon permits and a significant position in low-risk 2-year bonds yielding 4%. George also has funds with Investec yielding 3.6%. His current cash reserve is approximately £130,000. Clive recommended checking the Raisin platform for competitive savings rates, mentioning Aldermere at 4.29% and Shawbrook at 4.26% for easy access accounts. He highlighted that these accounts are protected up to £85,000 by the FSA compensation scheme, even with lesser-known banks like Alryan Bank. George previously invested $80,000 for his son Gareth in March 2018 and an additional $19,000 in April 2021, split between his and Alison's accounts, for which he is requesting an estimated current value.

Value: Gareth, George's son, is expected to earn in excess of £300,000 in the UK and will be subject to a 47% tax rate on income above £125,000, which George anticipates will be a significant shock for him compared to US taxation.

Evidence: "clive.martin: There are 3 things I'm getting clients to think about. Well, let's go back and stage. what is your view about that? Is it A, I don't give a monkeys that someone else's problems. B, … I am worried about that, but I'm also worried about my own expenditure. Or C, no, I want to make sure that the government gets as little money as possible. I think I tend to go on C, really. That's… you know, I don't want the government to get my money, but there again, you know… We haven't got a massive… expenditure wish list, or whatever. That hasn't changed. So, yes, I want to spend more on the money that I've got now. I'd like to get it to my children now, if I could. In some method, to make sure we have enough money. So, the things that I always think, I'm going to get to a stage Maybe, maybe not, I don't know. Let's say… in another 15 years' time, or wherever 20 years' time, where I'm going, well, Mum and Dad, you've got to go into a home. You know, the cost of that is, I've always said, the million pounds in the house will cover that, I would think. I would hope it would, because the average life span of someone going into a home, I know, is… is less than 4 years. It is. So, you know, I've calculated that out and got, well, that… that will cover us for a home for that period. So the money. So that then leaves about, you know, two… two… two… 2.7 million to get rid of, somehow. Without the taxman getting hold of it. Per se. Now, it might be that I pop my clogs next year, and Alison does as well, or whatever. … Cool. You don't know, you can't…. you need a crystal ball, and I'm not sure if anyone's got any one of those. But I would like to… if there was a way of being able to say, actually, I could do… you know, you read about these trusts or stuff, and then you're the people that are being caught by them, or whatever, or leaving your house in a deed for someone else, and the children get caught with a tax implication, as we did with Alison's mothers. et cetera, et cetera. Well, I'd like to find… I know that I can give the money to the kids at the moment, and I do, and point of fact, I give more than, I think, seven grand or whatever it is at the moment to them. But my view is they're such small amounts that, you know, no one declares it, and I don't think anyone can find out, really, unless the taxman comes along and says, oh, let's have a look at his account. Well, my ears are slightly shutting at those comments, but, so…. I know. Let's be black and white, but the, … a pet is basically you should live 7 years, so you live 7 years in regards to that. And if… if in the event that, on your death, that the HMRC are worried about it, they can go back into your situation, and then they can… they can dig everything up. Yeah. So, … I will perhaps send you a form that you can look at if you want to record this on a regular basis, because I'll show you. If you've got income versus expenditure rules, where you've got more income than expenditure, you can gift that money out on a monthly basis, or over the year, and that is automatically outside your estate. But you need to record it, because if someone comes back in and says. You know. what the hell was that? Then you need to prove it, otherwise it'll go back into the estate, and you might get, you know. But also from the point of view, if you don't live the 7 years. So, one should be, right now, more… Than ever, to be clear, because they'll have the ability to check the accounts. So, that's one. I think one of the, … There's some simple stuff. that I think people should consider. But before, before I do that, what do you think your general expenditure is, then? If you're being conservative and say, well, I want to have a certain amount of income to enjoy, what do you reckon the number is, in terms of your point of view? I don't know, actually, to be honest. What would you say you're spending now? You said Alison's spending about 1500 quid a month. And you're spending about, …. Yeah, I mean…. Well, you must be spending roughly about 50, aren't you? Yes. I was gonna say 50. I would think, between us. We've got an annual expenditure of between… Yeah, 60 to 70, I would think, with the other bits and pieces. But then, on top of that, you know, we draw down maybe 10, 15K for holidays or other bits and pieces like that, new, whatever. No, no, so, so, so, … I was ver… so, I would… I would think that, basically, you should probably be thinking about $85,000 a year, which is $70,000, what I call day-to-day expenditures, and gives you 15 grand for a float for holidays and stuff like that. Yeah. Does that seem fair? Yeah. So then… and then you get into the sort of more brutal camp thought process. Well, how long am I going to live for? Right? I know. And if you take the normal average, so you might, you might, as one client said to me, I'm way above average, I'm going to live way, way beyond the average. I said, fine, then you should plan on that basis, but as a starting point. So, … Married men are 86, and married women are 89 at the moment, roughly, according to the statistics. Really? Yeah, as a… as a… as a number. It's only an average, so, you know, obviously some people, you know, we've got the woman who's living, who's 116 today, so, you know, there's quite a… quite a wide scope. But clearly, part of that is that data includes COVID, and obviously a lot of people died in COVID. So, you know, so that has an impact, but… So, if you took whatever figure we worked on. So if we said 85,000, and then we… and then we multiplied, You're… 72? Yeah. Okay, so if we took… if we took, … Sorry, 85,000. And we took 20 years, that takes you to 92. So that gives you a bit more on the upside. … So you need £1.7 million worth of assets. A big cup. about it. Over that 20 years. Yeah. Now… … This is why you need to have a sort of chew over in your own mind, you think whether this sort of makes sense. So, 85,000, … … Divided by 2 sixths. So if you took $85,000 out, that's about 3.2% of your pot. Right, okay. So, if you're looking at… So, we work on a figure that, if you're talking about an income, if you look at a 4% figure. Has been conservative long-term asset returns of assets, and if we're in a balanced portfolio, we're trying to make 5, so there's another better than 1% buffer in regards to that. So you're below the 4%, so… As a starting point. That would mean if you took that $85,000 out. Each year, and we made 4%. You'd have all that money still there, plus a bit more. In 20 years' time. Yeah, I think you always said that when we first started this conversation off some 15, 20 years ago, about how much I'd have left when we, you know, if you carried on taking this amount. George Williams: And even now, I still look at the pension pot, and I go, it's exactly the same as it was, like. George Williams: 10 years ago, 1.3 million, or 1.2 million. It's exactly the same. So, so… What that basically says is there's probably a bit of… there's a bit of, freedom in terms of stuff that even if you… as you know. you spend more money in the first 10, 10, 15 years, it then flattens out, and then it starts coming down. So the reality is, if you're building a buffer, you're probably not going to be spending that in 5-10 years' time. Yeah, yeah. … And don't forget, obviously, you review each year anyway, so, but on the basis of that. And you've already got to… so… You've still got, in our view, 900,000 above the level you think you probably need. Yeah. But… That's just the start… this is what… this is what I mean about… this is just a starting figure. Now, the question is, is that still there? Paying $1.2 million. Of the whole thing. So if you did nothing, and it carried on growing in another 20 years. The likelihood is that that bill's likely to go up slightly over time. Because your other assets will have gone up as well, so, … The bill's likely to get bigger. So, I would say to clients. if you're comfortable with your number being good, and, you know, $85,000 as a starting point, I think is a reasonable go at it. That's not say you can't change your mind at any point, by the way, you're not locked into the 20 years, you can only take 85 grand back, and that would be silly." (Page 14-17)
Value: Strategies discussed to mitigate Inheritance Tax (IHT) liability include gifting money as Potentially Exempt Transfers (PETs) with a 7-year rule, recording gifts made from surplus income or expenditure to ensure they are outside the estate, and considering a whole-of-life insurance policy to cover a portion of the IHT bill. Another key strategy is setting up a discretionary trust using the £325,000 nil rate band, which would be outside the estate after 7 years and allows for flexible distributions to beneficiaries (children and grandchildren) while any growth is taxed at 6% after 10 years. Other options mentioned are Business Relief (100% IHT relief after 2 years for up to £1 million) and AIM Index investments (50% relief after 2 years). Downsizing property to release capital for gifting is also noted as a potential strategy. Pensions for grandchildren (£3,600 annual contribution with 20% tax relief, considered a PET) and Junior ISAs (£9,000 annual allowance) are also suggested.

Value: George Williams strongly prefers to ensure the government receives "as little money as possible" from his estate in Inheritance Tax (IHT). He is interested in strategies that allow him to pass wealth to his children now, while still retaining enough to cover potential future expenses like care home costs, which he estimates his £1 million house would cover.

I can't… I can't read my own writing in terms of your… what the total amount you've got with us. … So, if I… My total investments, you're right, well, if we take everything from the investments that I've got, like, everywhere. That's my cash, and also the cash that you have. That's about $2.7 million. The house is worth a million, and that gives me a total worth at the moment, I reckon, of $3.7 million.

So, yes, I want to spend more on the money that I've got now. I'd like to get it to my children now, if I could. In some method, to make sure we have enough money. So, the things that I always think, I'm going to get to a stage Maybe, maybe not, I don't know. Let's say… in another 15 years' time, or wherever 20 years' time, where I'm going, well, Mum and Dad, you've got to go into a home. You know, the cost of that is, I've always said, the million pounds in the house will cover that, I would think. I would hope it would, because the average life span of someone going into a home, I know, is… is less than 4 years. It is. So, you know, I've calculated that out and got, well, that… that will cover us for a home for that period. So the money. So that then leaves about, you know, two… two… two… 2.7 million to get rid of, somehow. Without the taxman getting hold of it. Per se. Now, it might be that I pop my clogs next year, and Alison does as well, or whatever. … Cool. You don't know, you can't…. you need a crystal ball, and I'm not sure if anyone's got any one of those. But I would like to… if there was a way of being able to say, actually, I could do… you know, you read about these trusts or stuff, and then you're the people that are being caught by them, or whatever, or leaving your house in a deed for someone else, and the children get caught with a tax implication, as we did with Alison's mothers. et cetera, et cetera. Well, I'd like to find… I know that I can give the money to the kids at the moment, and I do, and point of fact, I give more than, I think, seven grand or whatever it is at the moment to them. But my view is they're such small amounts that, you know, no one declares it, and I don't think anyone can find out, really, unless the taxman comes along and says, oh, let's have a look at his account. Well, my ears are slightly shutting at those comments, but, so…. I know. Let's be black and white, but the, … a pet is basically you should live 7 years, so you live 7 years in regards to that. And if… if in the event that, on your death, that the HMRC are worried about it, they can go back into your situation, and then they can… they can dig everything up. Yeah. So, … I will perhaps send you a form that you can look at if you want to record this on a regular basis, because I'll show you. If you've got income versus expenditure rules, where you've got more income than expenditure, you can gift that money out on a monthly basis, or over the year, and that is automatically outside your estate. But you need to record it, because if someone comes back in and says. You know. what the hell was that? Then you need to prove it, otherwise it'll go back into the estate, and you might get, you know. But also from the point of view, if you don't live the 7 years. So, one should be, right now, more… Than ever, to be clear, because they'll have the ability to check the accounts. So, that's one. I think one of the, … There's some simple stuff. that I think people should consider. But before, before I do that, what do you think your general expenditure is, then? If you're being conservative and say, well, I want to have a certain amount of income to enjoy, what do you reckon the number is, in terms of your point of view? I don't know, actually, to be honest. What would you say you're spending now? You said Alison's spending about 1500 quid a month. And you're spending about, …. Yeah, I mean…. Well, you must be spending roughly about 50, aren't you? Yes. I was gonna say 50. I would think, between us. We've got an annual expenditure of between… Yeah, 60 to 70, I would think, with the other bits and pieces. But then, on top of that, you know, we draw down maybe 10, 15K for holidays or other bits and pieces like that, new, whatever. No, no, so, so, so, … I was ver… so, I would… I would think that, basically, you should probably be thinking about $85,000 a year, which is $70,000, what I call day-to-day expenditures, and gives you 15 grand for a float for holidays and stuff like that. Yeah. Does that seem fair? Yeah. So then… and then you get into the sort of more brutal camp thought process. Well, how long am I going to live for? Right? I know. And if you take the normal average, so you might, you might, as one client said to me, I'm way above average, I'm going to live way, way beyond the average. I said, fine, then you should plan on that basis, but as a starting point. So, … Married men are 86, and married women are 89 at the moment, roughly, according to the statistics. Really? Yeah, as a… as a… as a number. It's only an average, so, you know, obviously some people, you know, we've got the woman who's living, who's 116 today, so, you know, there's quite a… quite a wide scope. But clearly, part of that is that data includes COVID, and obviously a lot of people died in COVID. So, you know, so that has an impact, but… So, if you took whatever figure we worked on. So if we said 85,000, and then we… and then we multiplied, You're… 72? Yeah. Okay, so if we took… if we took, … Sorry, 85,000. And we took 20 years, that takes you to 92. So that gives you a bit more on the upside. … So you need £1.7 million worth of assets. A big cup. about it. Over that 20 years. Yeah. Now… … This is why you need to have a sort of chew over in your own mind, you think whether this sort of makes sense. So, 85,000, … … Divided by 2 sixths. So if you took $85,000 out, that's about 3.2% of your pot. Right, okay. So, if you're looking at… So, we work on a figure that, if you're talking about an income, if you look at a 4% figure. Has been conservative long-term asset returns of assets, and if we're in a balanced portfolio, we're trying to make 5, so there's another better than 1% buffer in regards to that. So you're below the 4%, so… As a starting point. That would mean if you took that $85,000 out. Each year, and we made 4%. You'd have all that money still there, plus a bit more. In 20 years' time. Yeah, I think you always said that when we first started this conversation off some 15, 20 years ago, about how much I'd have left when we, you know, if you carried on taking this amount. George Williams: And even now, I still look at the pension pot, and I go, it's exactly the same as it was, like. George Williams: 10 years ago, 1.3 million, or 1.2 million. It's exactly the same. So, so… What that basically says is there's probably a bit of… there's a bit of, freedom in terms of stuff that even if you… as you know. you spend more money in the first 10, 10, 15 years, it then flattens out, and then it starts coming down. So the reality is, if you're building a buffer, you're probably not going to be spending that in 5-10 years' time. Yeah, yeah. … And don't forget, obviously, you review each year anyway, so, but on the basis of that. And you've already got to… so… You've still got, in our view, 900,000 above the level you think you probably need. Yeah. But… That's just the start… this is what… this is what I mean about… this is just a starting figure. Now, the question is, is that still there? Paying $1.2 million. Of the whole thing. So if you did nothing, and it carried on growing in another 20 years. The likelihood is that that bill's likely to go up slightly over time. Because your other assets will have gone up as well, so, … The bill's likely to get bigger. So, I would say to clients. if you're comfortable with your number being good, and, you know, $85,000 as a starting point, I think is a reasonable go at it. That's not say you can't change your mind at any point, by the way, you're not locked into the 20 years, you can only take 85 grand back, and that would be silly." (Page 14-17), "clive.martin: Okay, so, so, we talked about the business tax relief, the one you can do for 2 years. Yeah. You can go up to a million quid, so that's, that's another option. And then you've got AIM, the AIM Index. Right. Which is… which is basically smaller, smaller companies, and you invest in that, and after 2 years, you've got a 50% relief. So you put 100 grand in, 50 grand is automatic outside your estate after 2 years. Right, okay. And the last thing is, that most people don't do. Is basically you can trade down on your house, and then gift some money away. So if you're saying your house is worth a million quid. Yep. I said to you, George, will you ever leave your home? And most people go, no, I won't. No. I'm really happy where I am, blah blah blah, all that stuff. I'm really happy where I am, blah blah blah, all that stuff. And I say to you, well, is there… is there somewhere, as you get older, … And again… Do you want to live on that hill? Don't… don't… don't you want a flat. A flat place as you get older. Question mark. Yeah, I know, I understand, yeah. And then the issue on that is, is that going to release some capital, which will then give you more money to either spend or Protect yourself, or gift. Because it's the property, it's the most illiquid thing. Yeah." (Page 22), "clive.martin: I should have mentioned. Are you active on 2 minutes, just not 2 minutes? Yeah, no, I've got to go shortly, because I've got a meeting at 6.15, yeah. 2027 is when the… allegedly, the SIP will come into the… into your estate. Right. Now, they just had 6 months of consultation, and you can't tax a trust on death. So, if they want to change… if they change this rule, they're gonna have to change the rules, they're gonna have to do an Act of Parliament. So there's discussion now about pushing it out to 2028. If you do… if you push it out to 2028, the next election is 2029. If you did that and dragged everyone into an IHT bill, liability, in 2028, What are the chances of being elected in 2029? Yeah, none. So… so… Look, you don't… we think that it's not the most sensible thing, they haven't really understood it well enough to see the impact. … And I think they'll be pushing that out, and it won't… won't… No. But it's always possible it could come in, and therefore, if it does come in, that just makes it worse." (Page 24), "clive.martin: But most people don't do that, and… They get to a point, and they just go, oh, fantastic, so I've got free money, no one's ever talked to me about it. Well, on that basis, I'm just gonna… you know… What were we like at 18? Well, we'll spend it. Oh, can I go to Canada Rugby Tour? I'm going, see ya, bye!" (Page 23)
Value: George Williams' estimated estate value of £3.7 million (comprising £2.7 million in investments and a £1 million property) currently faces an Inheritance Tax (IHT) liability of £1.2 million, calculated as 40% of his estate after deducting the £650,000 nil rate band. George explicitly states he wants to minimize the amount the government receives from his estate and is keen to pass money to his children now.
Clive has outlined several tax planning strategies:
1. Gifting: George currently gifts more than the annual £3,000 allowance to his children, but does not formally record these. Clive advises that all gifts should be recorded, especially those from surplus income, as these can be considered Potentially Exempt Transfers (PETs) and will be outside the estate if George lives for 7 years after the gift. HMRC can retrospectively investigate gifts if not properly recorded.
2. Life Cover: A whole-of-life plan is recommended, estimated to cover £200,000-£250,000 of the IHT bill. This policy would pay out on the second death and could cost approximately £500 per month (£6,000 annually). This, combined with a discretionary trust, could effectively halve the IHT bill.
3. Discretionary Trust: Establishing a discretionary trust using the £325,000 nil rate band. This sum would be outside the estate after 7 years and can be invested. Any growth on this amount (above £325,000) would be taxed at 6% after 10 years, a significantly lower rate than the 40% IHT. George and Alison would be the trustees, retaining control over who (children, grandchildren) receives distributions and in what amounts, offering flexibility for family support (e.g., school fees, house deposits). Another trust could be established after 7 years if the previous one matured outside the estate.
4. Business Relief and AIM Investments: Briefly mentioned as more aggressive IHT mitigation options; Business Relief offers 100% IHT relief after 2 years for up to £1 million invested, while AIM Index investments provide 50% relief after 2 years.
5. Property Downsizing: Downsizing their £1 million property to release capital for gifting or other IHT strategies is suggested, although George is currently happy in his home.
6. Pensions for Grandchildren: Contributing £3,600 annually to a pension for each grandchild, which benefits from 20% tax relief (costing £2,880) and is treated as a PET after 7 years, providing long-term savings.
7. Junior ISAs: Using Junior ISAs for grandchildren with an annual allowance of £9,000, offering flexible savings accessible at age 18.
Clive stresses the urgency of implementing some strategies, particularly trusts, before the budget at the end of October, due to potential changes in IHT rules under a Labour government. He also mentions that the SIP (Self-Invested Pension) is allegedly due to come into the estate by 2027, though this is currently under consultation and may be pushed out to 2028. George's son, Gareth, returning from the US to a salary in excess of £300,000, is expected to face a significant "shock" due to the UK's 47% tax rate on income over £125,000.

Evidence: "clive.martin: The third one is actually, buying some life cover. Okay. Now, so you've probably never thought about this, but a whole-of-life plan, which basically can pay out on the second death. We'll pay part of the bill, Or also, is if you do some planning, if you've got another 20 years to go, then you're… if you do some planning, that gives us plenty of time to reduce the estate. If that makes sense. Yes. So… what I would… what I would… the way I work… the way I weigh and work this out… Is, broadly speaking, between 10 or 20% of what your figure is today is the amount that you should probably insure yourself for if you want to go down to the life cover route. So that's probably about £200,000, is 200, 250,000 life cover. Now, … What that means, in simple terms, is that you know that in the event there's a second death, it will be paid out to your beneficiaries. And those beneficiaries can be your children or their grandchildren, depending on how you want to do that. But you know that they will have a certain amount of money that they can then either use that money for themselves, or to pay some of the bill if there isn't, you know, it could take a while to pay that bill. So, so, … And you can stop that at any time if you want to. So if you've got rid of all your estate and everything's there, you don't need it anymore, you don't have to pay it any longer. So… but I do think it's something that most people, should think about as part of the package that I think, in terms of planning, it works. Okay. Now… The next one, you talked about trust, and you had that sort of skeptical look about, or trust the bloody complicated, they've all gone horribly wrong. So there are, there are, … have you heard or ever thought about a thing called a discretionary trust?" (Page 18-19), "George Williams: So, on the… going back to the life cover, how much does that cost? Well, that would depend on, on, two factors. Your age and your health. And obviously, what we do is simply… I can easily do it, I'm doing it… I'm doing it every day at the moment. Okay. Get you a quote for a number, and then you can see whether you think, oh, that's far too expensive, or that seems really reasonable, whatever. But I think… As a combination, you add those, just doing those two things, That's almost halving the bill. Yeah. No, I say that. So, 3 to 5… You're… you are losing it, but you're… you're still in control of it. You can still spend it. The trust can still spend it, but obviously it's the beneficiaries who have to spend it. Yeah. So, it'll be… it's completely up to you who they are. Yeah. So, that's…. Yeah, so my beneficiaries could well be… Yeah, my son, my daughter, and my grandchildren. Well, I mean, I'm going to say the obvious thing, depending on the age of the children and so forth, but, By skipping two generations. Yeah? That's proper financial planning. Because if… And again, this is where… this is where it becomes important, and this is where you come important in terms of where you choose it. If you think… Gareth doesn't need the money. Yeah. But it's useful for the grandchildren. You might want to give the money to the grandchildren. If your daughter, however, needs the money for her. Helping out with the kids, you might want to give it to her. That's the whole point of a discretionary, and only you will know how that… how that fits. Right, so we can put them in there for it, but do you have to decide when you do this discretionary trust? that they all get the equal amounts, or can it be, again, discretionary about, actually, I want to give them that amount, and her that amount? That's why it's called a discretionary trust. That's what… that's why… sorry, I was just wanting qualification on that, yeah. And that's why, in your particular case. Look, you can do a thing called a bear trust, which is simply, I'm… It's 50 grand for one of my grandchildren, but it… once it's absolutely… it can't change. I don't think you want that, and should need that. I think you should want to have that full discretionary in regards to that process. Yeah. Yeah. But you can't get to that point, should I do it, until you're happy with The first thought process is, well. if 85 grand… if 85 grand's a starting point, and I multiply that by 20, and I've still got my 1.7 million. Why do I need this extra bits? Okay. Now, so, … And there are other stuff that you can look at, which is… which is, … More risky in the sense of investment stuff, but you can do business relief. Up to a million quid a year, which, if you invest in it, and you last two years, it's 100% outside your estate. But that's more for people who Perhaps got maybe a bit more, or are slightly older, who've only got a short period of time to live, and that's the only way around getting the money out of the estate. I think, if you did those two things, and you did some income and expenditure and some potential gifts outright. … You know, just on those two, two things at $250 and a 3, you've halved the bill. Almost half of the bill. Without… without actually… the only costing is basically… is your slightly excess pain for the life cover. So, just… sorry, I'm just a little bit… reiterate for me how the life cover actually works again. So, I pay a premium. Yeah, you pay a premium, and let's call it 500 quid a month, let's just come up with a number. So it's 6 grand a year, and you live 20 years, that's what you… you'd have paid out 120 grand in terms of, of premiums. And it will pay out $250,000 in terms of… on death. Right, okay. Okay. So do you do it for a period of time, or is it once it's set up, that's it? that's what a whole of life is a whole of life until you… the second die… person dies. So you carry on paying that premium for that… for that length of time. So if you both got killed in a car crash the second month. You'll have paid one premium, and $250,000 would be paid. But if I live for another 20 years. For 20 years, we've paid out £120,000 in premiums, but you're still getting £250,000 on debt. So your break-even point, you'd have to live probably 40 years. Okay, I'm with it, I'm with it, with it. Yeah, I… I… I understand. And the reason why you look at both. as a combination, why I think it's useful. It's because you don't know how long you're gonna live for. No. Question, is that done on both of our lives, or is that done on…. No, it's done both of your lives. So what… and when does that… So if, if let's say…. I died first. Yep. Does… does that mature at that point, or…? No, no, so it only pays out on the second death, so you keep paying the premiums on the second death. So, so… Would the premium then reduce, or not? No, it would still be the same? No. Okay, alright, that just… yeah, fine. No, I understand. Okay. But… but ultimately, You've got two simple decisions to make that are complicated to agree on. Is $85,000 is a good starting point for the next 20 years, and you have all that money, … We know the mass is 1.7 million. So, if that figure is good in your mind, then you know you're going to have some surplus. So, all I… all I'm saying is, on that basis, if we just start with this, you've got 900 surplus. If you took 325 out, and you do some life covers on the side, you've still got about 600,000 left. And you then got 20 years, to… decrease the, the bill. In simple terms, I mean, you'll spend a bit more money. Or gifted out, depending on how you want to do it. Right, okay. Yeah. Fine. So you said 5 points. I think that was 4. Okay, so, so, we talked about the business tax relief, the one you can do for 2 years. Yeah. You can go up to a million quid, so that's, that's another option. And then you've got AIM, the AIM Index. Right. Which is… which is basically smaller, smaller companies, and you invest in that, and after 2 years, you've got a 50% relief. So you put 100 grand in, 50 grand is automatic outside your estate after 2 years. Right, okay." (Page 18-22), "George Williams: It is. I like that discussion, Ritas, and the life cover. I'm not so keen on that, but I can see the benefit of that, and absolutely, as you say, you get the money back. easily over 50%, plus. Okay." (Page 24)
Value: Clive suggested a whole-of-life plan as a protection product to help mitigate Inheritance Tax (IHT) liability. This policy would pay out on the second death (i.e., after both George and Alison have passed away) and could cover a target amount of £200,000 to £250,000 of the IHT bill. The premium for such a policy would depend on George's and Alison's age and health, with an example cost of £500 per month (£6,000 per year). If paid for 20 years, total premiums would be £120,000 for a £250,000 payout. The policy can be stopped at any time if it is no longer required. George acknowledges the benefit of such a plan, although he is "not so keen" on life cover generally. The policy is designed to provide funds to beneficiaries who can then use it to cover IHT or for their own purposes.

Evidence: "George Williams: Yeah, I mean, it's funny enough, this week, all I've had is letters from Chantendere, Halifax, I mean, I haven't got lots of money with them or anything, just saying, you know, please note our interest rates have gone down. George Williams: And they're going down, seems like, everywhere at the moment. Yeah. So, I mean, I think the best I've got at the moment is 3.6 from Investec. George Williams: Which I think is still pretty good, actually. …. So, so… I think I've told you before about raisin. Yes. Yeah. Well, if you looked on Raisin, if you've got your iPad there. Yeah. Go on. Look under it now, Raisin, and look under flexible accounts. I think you'll find that some… still some good rates available, and you can still get some good fixed rates as well. Really. It's really annoying, actually, because… For some reason, the rugby club… I'm not in the finances side, but the rugby club had 14 grand, which it said, … well, it's just sitting in an account, this was last year, so we'll invest it in a bond, and I didn't look at it. And they got the results back, and it was something like, you know, 2.5% from a fixed bond. And I went, hang on a minute, you surely must have done better than that. And they just reinvested it again at about the same rate. And I said, well, I know you can get a lot better rate of interest from a lot of other companies on things like that, so I don't know who he was using or why he was using them. … Yeah, I mean… Hash management is also going to be quite important, I think, going forward. The big banks are basically cleaning up. They're just slashing rates. And they're making on the arbitrage, but some of these newer ones, where am I? Savings accounts. Yeah, 4.29% Aldermere. 4.28. 4.26… You get some good rates, can't you? I've never heard of any of those, but there you go! So, so, so that's the first thing that most clients talk to me about. And by the way, this is not a Saltous recommendation, this is just a Clyde Martin thing, you should have a look at it. Blade Martin. You should have started your own business up, Clive. Well, plenty should say that, no, no, I'm joking. But, … the reason why I like it as… to suggest, have a look. You can't get… you can't buy more than the maximum amount under the FSA in one account, so if the maximum's $85,000, You can put no more than $85,000 in that account if you're doing a 1-year fixed bond, or a 3-year fixed bond, or whatever. So, in other words, you can't… the money can't be lost under the FSA compensation scheme. Does that make sense? Right, yeah. Is it 85,000 now? It is £85,000. Yeah, sorry, you're looking at me, and I was thinking, yes. So, so the fixed rate… Yes. So, so…. They all say they're FCS protected, so…. So, so… Some of the banks, you may not, sort of, have a, sort of, penchance for, like, … Alryan Bank, you can guess where that's probably coming from. But… But they all have to apply to the FCA scenario. So, It's 85,000, it says here, yeah, max 85. So, all of them… They can't get on, so… From that point of view, if they go bust, Yes, Greg. So… … So, it means when you've got your millions, George, sort of floating around your cash bank, you'll have to give a lot of $85,000s. That's the only problem. Yeah, that is very true, isn't it? You'd have to invest in quite a lot. But, but, even on the easy access. The top easy access on that is 4.26 with a company called Shawbrook. Right. … So, all I'm saying is, I mean, some of these rates are coming down, but… Yeah. These are the most attractive in the market, because they're just trying to get the money in, They've got a loan book and they want to fill it up. Yeah. No, no, no, absolutely. So, I mean, I think… I think last year, my portfolio in a year, when I looked at it this morning, I think in a year was around 7.6%. Your portfolio with us? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's about… sounds about right. That sounds about right. Yeah. And… and obviously, if you go at 7%, that compounds at, that doubles over 10 years. Yeah, I mean, even… I mean, I think over something like… I think I looked at 3-year one, was the other one, and that was… I was quite gobsmacked by that, it was 21%. Yeah. Over 3 years, which, you know, in…. Which includes one of the worst years ever. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, it's like, yeah. So, I think since… since COVID, near enough, we've really, sort of, come out of the… Thank you. COVID is… from COVID to now, it's been our best five years ever. Yeah. Yeah, I haven't looked… I didn't look at 5 years, but I looked at 3. Well, if you remember COVID 2000 and 2000, it went down 36% in 6 weeks. I know. I know! Look at it, then. I knew what it was going to be like, so I don't… I don't like inflicting pain on myself. You know, I'm one of these people that goes, can I do anything about that? No, I can't. Well, I could have done. I could have said, sell everything up now. I don't want to lose any more money. But at the end of the day, you will… it will go… it goes back. When it goes down, it always comes back. I mean, I've got a very simple philosophy about these things, you know, you can't… You can't do anything about it, so you just get on with your life, and it is what it is."

They can do $3,600, you get 20% relief on the contribution, so any cost $2,880. Yeah. That's considered a pet, so you live 7 years, it goes outside the estate, but they then have a pension at an early age, and basically they can't… don't forget, they can't get at it until Yes. 58, as it were, so if you think you want to have a real long-term planning scenario. Yeah. You can do that. And you can also do a junior ISA, which is 9 grand. So, if you wanted to have a little, you know, as some grandparents do, and they go, right, how many grandchildren I got? I'm going to give 10 grand to each grandchild. They go, right, I'll… Some of it goes into the ISA, because then that's flexible, they can… they can touch it when they're past 18, and that puts some money into a pension. That sorts that whole thing out, and then that's outside the estate, and you know, you know, basically, that's a good thing for them. And they can't touch it for a period of time." (Page 23)

(Page 6), "George Williams: I mean, I think the best I've got at the moment is 3.6 from Investec." (Page 6), "clive.martin: So, so… I think I've told you before about raisin. Yes. Yeah. Well, if you looked on Raisin, if you've got your iPad there. Yeah. Go on. Look under it now, Raisin, and look under flexible accounts. I think you'll find that some… still some good rates available, and you can still get some good fixed rates as well. Really. It's really annoying, actually, because… For some reason, the rugby club… I'm not in the finances side, but the rugby club had 14 grand, which it said, … well, it's just sitting in an account, this was last year, so we'll invest it in a bond, and I didn't look at it. And they got the results back, and it was something like, you know, 2.5% from a fixed bond. And I went, hang on a minute, you surely must have done better than that. And they just reinvested it again at about the same rate. And I said, well, I know you can get a lot better rate of interest from a lot of other companies on things like that, so I don't know who he was using or why he was using them. … Yeah, I mean… Hash management is also going to be quite important, I think, going forward. The big banks are basically cleaning up. They're just slashing rates. And they're making on the arbitrage, but some of these newer ones, where am I? Savings accounts. Yeah, 4.29% Aldermere. 4.28. 4.26… You get some good rates, can't you? I've never heard of any of those, but there you go! So, so, so that's the first thing that most clients talk to me about. And by the way, this is not a Saltous recommendation, this is just a Clyde Martin thing, you should have a look at it. Blade Martin. You should have started your own business up, Clive. Well, plenty should say that, no, no, I'm joking. But, … the reason why I like it as… to suggest, have a look. You can't get… you can't buy more than the maximum amount under the FSA in one account, so if the maximum's $85,000, You can put no more than $85,000 in that account if you're doing a 1-year fixed bond, or a 3-year fixed bond, or whatever. So, in other words, you can't… the money can't be lost under the FSA compensation scheme. Does that make sense? Right, yeah. Is it 85,000 now? It is £85,000. Yeah, sorry, you're looking at me, and I was thinking, yes. So, so the fixed rate… Yes. So, so…. They all say they're FCS protected, so…. So, so… Some of the banks, you may not, sort of, have a, sort of, penchance for, like, … Alryan Bank, you can guess where that's probably coming from. But… But they all have to apply to the FCA scenario. So, It's 85,000, it says here, yeah, max 85. So, all of them… They can't get on, so… From that point of view, if they go bust, Yes, Greg. So… … So, it means when you've got your millions, George, sort of floating around your cash bank, you'll have to give a lot of $85,000s. That's the only problem. Yeah, that is very true, isn't it? You'd have to invest in quite a lot. But, but, even on the easy access. The top easy access on that is 4.26 with a company called Shawbrook. Right. … So, all I'm saying is, I mean, some of these rates are coming down, but… Yeah. These are the most attractive in the market, because they're just trying to get the money in, They've got a loan book and they want to fill it up. Yeah. No, no, no, absolutely. So, I mean, I think… I think last year, my portfolio in a year, when I looked at it this morning, I think in a year was around 7.6%. Your portfolio with us? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's about… sounds about right. That sounds about right. Yeah. And… and obviously, if you go at 7%, that compounds at, that doubles over 10 years. Yeah, I mean, even… I mean, I think over something like… I think I looked at 3-year one, was the other one, and that was… I was quite gobsmacked by that, it was 21%. Yeah. Over 3 years, which, you know, in…. Which includes one of the worst years ever. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, it's like, yeah. So, I think since… since COVID, near enough, we've really, sort of, come out of the… Thank you. COVID is… from COVID to now, it's been our best five years ever. Yeah. Yeah, I haven't looked… I didn't look at 5 years, but I looked at 3. Well, if you remember COVID 2000 and 2000, it went down 36% in 6 weeks. I know. I know! Look at it, then.

Evidence: "clive.martin: So, supposedly the quiet time in summer has exploded into sort of a potpourri of a whole lot of different issues. Yeah, and Solter seemed to be suffering from IT issues at the moment with one of their suppliers. So, that, that has also not helped in the last, …. you can imagine. And … I mean. I'm probably the worst person to talk about this stuff, because I'm far too transparent, but, … It seems to me that In the great world of data and all this stuff. If someone attacks you, cyber attacks you. The main defense of what you do is you switch it off. Yeah. I know. Which… which seems to me a bit weird, because When it's switched off, if it doesn't work, then people will think, well, what's… what's wrong, unless… until they work out if they… so they… so they basically switched it off. I mean, … It's interesting because there are lots of other big providers in the same position. Oh, really? Well, I mean… It's… Yeah. Pantander, HSBC, you know, the whole…. Yeah, the whole one. It's not, … But, … The great thing is no… there's no data, there's no risk, except… except…. No, I've read it from the MD. Well, I'll add them along. But in essence, and it was typical, because basically the price didn't move, and of course the market went up the week that it did it. So. So I was hoping in my… and as I said to them, well, if it goes back on, then it's gone up, everyone's fund's gone up by 1%, they won't care. No. But if they've gone down by 5%, then that might be a bit of a different issue. Yeah, I mean, for people like myself, it doesn't really matter, because, you know, I turn… I go on there maybe once a month and look at, where are we now? Oh, that's good, you know, it's gone up by that much, or it's gone down by that much. So, it doesn't really worry me that much, but I can imagine there must be a lot of people out there that actually manage their portfolio a lot closer than, sort of. Well, I mean, to be honest, we're… I mean, we don't have many clients who do that. Right, okay. Well… simply because…. the whole purpose of coming to someone like ourselves is that…. So, if, you know, ultimately, at the end of the day, if you can see what it's doing all the time, if you want to, that's what a lot of people want to be able to switch on. Two, if there's an issue in regards to performance, then obviously there's someone to talk to in regards to that, and blah blah blah, and of course, we've got all the stuff, you know. You probably, you know, I don't know, don't know how you feel, but, … we over-egg information. We've got all that information on the portal, we've got, you know, the quarterly reports. I mean, there is no way people don't know how it's doing, good or bad. Right. So, you know, in some respects, that hopefully is calming. We think that's a calming effect over time. And if, I mean, go back to COVID… You know, we wrote a letter every month to say it has to get it's gone down by a bit more, blah blah blah, but… Interestingly enough, the best feedback we ever got Was that people thought. Well, they're just telling me all the time, and people are saying, well, no one else is writing to me. It's like, why aren't they writing to me? And… and you guys at Salted are, like, churning out paperwork every week. That's right. We, we think, we think it's a good idea, but look, it, it, … in the modern world, as you, you know, when everything… everyone says, well, you should go digital, young man, you know, everything, you know, and speed of… of information is, you know, everyone wants it faster and faster. Well. Trouble is, if someone cuts it off, or whatever, then it does have a slight problem. It has… it has a… and I mean, yeah, I mean, I was in it, as you know, for years, and it is… from what I can see now, it's getting more dangerous with AI and with what's happening in the marketplace, how people are going to actually secure their data. from certain elements of, scammers and whatever, I just find it ridiculous. You know, sometimes you go back to the old days, you had POW notes, and unless you were robbed, that was it. Your money was safe. Unfortunately, nowadays, it's just all up there in the cloud. And people get access to it. I don't care how good some of these people are, there's a better hacker somewhere that will get through the firewall, that will get through somewhere. It's… it's quite worrying." (Page 2-4), "George Williams: That is quite good. I mean, I did have a quick review of the market, of the platform. Obviously, it's not completely up-to-date, but… George Williams: I mean, in the last year, the market, and my money, seems to have gone up a flying rate. It's… the market's done very well, considering the state of the economy and labor and everything else at the moment. Well, I think, I think, if… if I was being, comp… One of the… Challenges going forward in the next decade. Is… is actually trying to work out How you get diversity. You know, because… If you're having, you know. They're equities, but equities in general, I mean, yes, they're gross equities, and yes, there's some conservative equities, but if there's a crash, they all go down. It's a question about how much they go down by. Yeah. You know, the bond market is all taken into interest rates and inflation, so, you know. In general, most bomb markets around the world behave the same. I mean, they're probably not so much at the moment, but you probably know what they're going to do. So to try and get a different slant on things is quite tricky. If you, if you, if you have a… So… So I'm the commodity buff on the IM committee, so on the asset, so we've had our highest commodity exposure of all time. Really? So, and at the moment, that commodity exposure has been gold and silver. So, if you… if you think about an average benchmark. Yes. Most people have 0% in gold and silver. Okay. So, we have had approximately ranging between 4% to 10% in the gold and silver market in the last 3 years in the portfolio. And, gold's up 100%. So, is it…. Really? Yep. And gold has outperformed the S&P. It's up 28% this year, and silver's up about 30%. So unless you know about these things. Yeah. You don't notice it, because no one has it. So you're a bit like the wolf, all on your own in the corner. the only time you notice it, if you have a big position in these, what I call… Slightly different vehicles. It only matters if it basically goes the opposite way, because your diversification doesn't work. Right, okay, yeah, I'm good. … But we do think… that commodities are in a bull market for the next decade. Oh, good. Now… The trouble about… the trouble about commodities… and much as I love commodities, they're smaller markets, they move quicker, and they're very volatile, both up and down. So, yeah. You have to be careful about sizing the position. That makes sense. Yes, but no…. 100%, I understand, yeah, yeah. And also how you trade them, because, … It's… it's difficult, … so you can have stop losses in… to a certain extent, in… in… a portfolio. So if you had, you know, a massive amount of Apple shares, and you wanted to cut the position if it went through 220p, you could basically put a stop loss in there, and it all gets automatically sold. It's a bit harder to do that in the In the commodity market. So, we are very, very diversified, for a number of reasons. One is that, In general terms, the things that are… big capacity. AI build data centers. EVs. You need a hell of a lot of copper. Yes, no, you're right, it is. It's…. And a lot of precious metals as well. So it takes about 10 years to… to find and build a… So you can't just turn the tattles, or I'd like to… I'd like to increase my copper, production by 300%, please. It's not possible. It doesn't happen. And of course, the speed at which the EV market and those sort of things is adoption. You know, everyone… everyone knows it's going to get to there at some point, but no one knows the, you know, how it gets there. So, Norway, for example, is now, this year, 100% of its car sales are EVs. Really? Now, that's… that's quite weird. you know, say that in the UK, and then we'll go, well… The only thing I want an EV car, because I'm not convinced I can fill it up further, how many out? You know, so that they're all… they're all going half what typical UK Conservative They're in the hybrid market. That's what's going on at the moment. Hybrid market is booming, electrical market is down by something like 50% of what they predicted, or less. So, so… Each country has its own things, but it's all to do with the infrastructure. Yeah. Because if you had, … If everyone could have an EV car and you could, you know. Plug it into your own home, and you all had solar panels. you know, you'll be… you'll be kids in. But of course, How long that's gonna take. I think, though, Clive, yes, I agree with all that, but one of the biggest things that people are thinking about, and the conversation I'm having with people that are having exactly the same conversations as to why they don't want to buy an EV car. It's simply reason, is that the batteries are not there yet, and that a car A, you have to pay more for an EV car at the moment. And B. literally, you drive it off the forecourt, and the price of it drops through the bottom, because after about 5 or 6 years, you won't be able to sell it, because people will go, well, I've only got about another 4 years' life out of it. Now, that is changing. But at the moment, the batteries are going, you know, they're… you know, after 10 years, you have to spend, like, thousands on new batteries. And at the moment, it does not make sense to buy an EV car. I understand that logic. … It. It's pretty clear that If you're in the short journey world. Yeah. then the EV is, like, because you save however much you save in terms of petrol and all those other stuff, so… so I think… 30-mile radius, if you're in and out of the, you know, it's quits in. As soon as you get past regular 50 mile… 50 miles every day type thing. I… I understand that. … … the speed at which these things happen. So, … But the, … so… copper, gold, silver. Silver has been… this is going to be the fifth year of, decrease in terms of, production versus demand, so you, you know… Wow. So… And if you look at the subsection of all those Those little macro fights that are going on. Yeah, you know. People… people… Why… why is Trump wanting to get on with Ukraine is because it's got minerals. Very many precious minerals there that he's already signing that agreement with them for. why is he… why does he not want to kill, China? Because they are the largest producers of those sort of things. So he doesn't want to be cut short, he wants to buy some time to basically stop producing and all that sort of stuff. Yeah. So it's clear that we are in an economic war already. Oh, gosh, massive, yeah. So, … Having those sort of stuff, and then if you run out, you can't… if you run out, you can't grow. None. And then you think of all the other stuff that buys with it. With the platforms and stuff. And, … I was, I was, … what was the word I'd use? People were slightly gobsmacked when I said to them. … I'm now in my 60s, and this is the first time I can genuinely ask the question, is USA a capitalist country, or has it become a communist and left-wing party? And my reason and rationale for that is, first time ever. There's a company called MD Materials, which is basically the only mineral company in the US, based in Las Vegas. Oh, right. And, … rather interesting, slow little headlines that never really got into the UK press, but obviously I'm a bit of a commodity nerd. The US government invested $400 million In… in shares in the company. Wow. The following week, Apple Bought 500 million pounds worth of stock as well, because they want guaranteed supply for some of the minerals that they want for their phones. Yeah? So… Did the government and Apple come to a nice little negotiation that basically has meant that that company has got the cap that needs to expand, and oh, and oh, and shit, oh, the share price went up 300% this year. Oh, that's interesting. Well, yeah. It is. They don't care, as long as they're getting the stuff. Yeah. That's the message that I'm getting. Yeah. And therefore, they don't, you know, don't worry about rules about, you know, shares and, you know, all that sort of stuff, so it's very, very… and of course. this week. I'm doing something about Intel. That's the… over the… whatever the… whatever the acts that Biden did. 400 million, or whatever, no, it was a bit more than that, actually. And, they're saying, oh, no, we're not gonna… we're gonna buy… we're gonna buy… we're gonna have to buy some equities in Intel, and the profit is gonna go back to the US, … Just, … … In a central place where we'd keep all the money. So they're now… so now they're… now they're giving money, but they're taking the profit and giving it back. It's like, hello? That's communist behavior. Yeah, it is. Well… Because if you said Donald Trump was a communist, you'd probably get a rather interesting hearing in the US. You would. Yeah, you have to… well, that's the problem with everything now, you have to be so careful what you say. You can't say a word out of place anywhere, otherwise to do good is it gonna fall on you like a ton of bloody… Bricks. So, the world is definitely changing. And therefore, just going back to diversification, you have to… … decide on what diversification, how those diversification cases, you know. So, … You've got that weird thing with… European defense stocks. Now, for the first time, Europe is basically coughing up and going to spend some money, and they're up 150-200% this year. Because finally, Well, I mean, they've… they… not… they've not wanted to do all that sort of stuff. Now they've got no choice but cough up and pay for the defense of… against Russia. Yeah…. Yeah. So, part of the reason and rationale is that having that… But… There are still lots of people who get very scared. When they go climbing. This is so off-piste. our allocation in that area. I said, Well… To be honest, we've been underweight. And they look at me and go, what do you mean they were underweight? Well… It doesn't happen very often. So if you're in a cyclical bull market for commodities, then… If you're not in it, you… they get… they will go up 300%. And I said to him, you look at the last disaster. That people forget about. Do you remember crude oil, what crude oil got to in, in, in COVID? Yes. It got to minus 10. It was… yeah. So, basically. The world's dead, we don't need any oil, we're getting rid of it. We're gonna give it away. I know, it's weird, isn't it? It's just…. And it went from minus 10… 280. So I said… so I said to them, so what return am I getting? And some bright sparks that we can't work that out, because if you start with a minus, it never works out. I said, okay, we'll just deal… deal with naught then. So…. So these things are… But you… you've got to be… you've got to be in it to win it, as they say. So, it's… It's a fascinating time in the world, it's not… I don't think it's going to carry on being… being like that, but… but… but… In the sense that… We think it's going to be easier and I say this with trepidation, looking at your face, it's easier to make an okay return You know, in the 5% campaign. Then trying to make a lot of money, because you'd have to be… Either lucky, or you get your timing right in some of that stuff. You know, uranium's up 85% this year. Yeah. … Who, who would say you'd have uranium in your portfolio? … Or, or nuclear energy. You know, if nuclear energy comes back. which it… which it probably will do as part of the whole thing, then that's gonna be. And then… We've actually got some carbon in our… in our portfolio. Carbon permits, I mean…. Really? That's really, you know, I mean, it's 0.5% of the portfolio. But if you said that to someone and went, oh, I've got carbon in my portfolio, they go, what the fuck do you want that for? Why? What? And then, we will, at some point. Be able to have some… Bitcoin and all that sort of stuff, long and short, hopefully. Yeah. Yeah. There's lots of little divers… so the world's… … In terms of that, but the most important thing is the clients are getting the returns they're expecting, and they're doing the things that they want to do with their money. That's… that's the way we always think about this stuff. Yeah. But at the same time, we've got a very big position, some very low-risk stuff, like… Two, two, two-year bonds. And they're giving us, you know, 4% with no risk, unless the US government goes bust. Yeah, yeah. I mean…. Yeah, I mean, it's funny enough, this week, all I've had is letters from Chantendere, Halifax, I mean, I haven't got lots of money with them or anything, just saying, you know, please note our interest rates have gone down. George Williams: And they're going down, seems like, everywhere at the moment. Yeah. So, I mean, I think the best I've got at the moment is 3.6 from Investec. George Williams: Which I think is still pretty good, actually. …. So, so… I think I've told you before about raisin. Yes. Yeah. Well, if you looked on Raisin, if you've got your iPad there. Yeah. Go on. Look under it now, Raisin, and look under flexible accounts. I think you'll find that some… still some good rates available, and you can still get some good fixed rates as well. Really. It's really annoying, actually, because… For some reason, the rugby club… I'm not in the finances side, but the rugby club had 14 grand, which it said, … well, it's just sitting in an account, this was last year, so we'll invest it in a bond, and I didn't look at it. And they got the results back, and it was something like, you know, 2.5% from a fixed bond. And I went, hang on a minute, you surely must have done better than that. And they just reinvested it again at about the same rate. And I said, well, I know you can get a lot better rate of interest from a lot of other companies on things like that, so I don't know who he was using or why he was using them. … Yeah, I mean… Hash management is also going to be quite important, I think, going forward. The big banks are basically cleaning up. They're just slashing rates. And they're making on the arbitrage, but some of these newer ones, where am I? Savings accounts. Yeah, 4.29% Aldermere. 4.28. 4.26… You get some good rates, can't you? I've never heard of any of those, but there you go! So, so, so that's the first thing that most clients talk to me about.

Yeah, sorry, you're looking at me, and I was thinking, yes. So, so the fixed rate… Yes. So, so…. They all say they're FCS protected, so…. So, so… Some of the banks, you may not, sort of, have a, sort of, penchance for, like, … Alryan Bank, you can guess where that's probably coming from. But… But they all have to apply to the FCA scenario. So, It's 85,000, it says here, yeah, max 85. So, all of them… They can't get on, so… From that point of view, if they go bust, Yes, Greg. So… … So, it means when you've got your millions, George, sort of floating around your cash bank, you'll have to give a lot of $85,000s. That's the only problem. Yeah, that is very true, isn't it? You'd have to invest in quite a lot. But, but, even on the easy access. The top easy access on that is 4.26 with a company called Shawbrook. Right. … So, all I'm saying is, I mean, some of these rates are coming down, but… Yeah. These are the most attractive in the market, because they're just trying to get the money in, They've got a loan book and they want to fill it up. Yeah. No, no, no, absolutely. So, I mean, I think… I think last year, my portfolio in a year, when I looked at it this morning, I think in a year was around 7.6%. Your portfolio with us? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's about… sounds about right. That sounds about right. Yeah. And… and obviously, if you go at 7%, that compounds at, that doubles over 10 years. Yeah, I mean, even… I mean, I think over something like… I think I looked at 3-year one, was the other one, and that was… I was quite gobsmacked by that, it was 21%. Yeah. Over 3 years, which, you know, in…. Which includes one of the worst years ever. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, it's like, yeah. So, I think since… since COVID, near enough, we've really, sort of, come out of the… Thank you. COVID is… from COVID to now, it's been our best five years ever. Yeah. Yeah, I haven't looked… I didn't look at 5 years, but I looked at 3. Well, if you remember COVID 2000 and 2000, it went down 36% in 6 weeks. I know. I know! Look at it, then. I knew what it was going to be like, so I don't… I don't like inflicting pain on myself. You know, I'm one of these people that goes, can I do anything about that? No, I can't. Well, I could have done. I could have said, sell everything up now. I don't want to lose any more money. But at the end of the day, you will… it will go… it goes back. When it goes down, it always comes back. I mean, I've got a very simple philosophy about these things, you know, you can't… You can't do anything about it, so you just get on with your life, and it is what it is." (Page 5-18), "clive.martin: I looked through, and she's got a healthy pot in there now of, like, I'm sure it's something like about 80 or 90,000 she's got in." (Page 12), "clive.martin: Yeah, well, look… If you're… if you're… you could pay a pension contribution for your grandchildren. Yeah. They can do $3,600, you get 20% relief on the contribution, so any cost $2,880. Yeah. That's considered a pet, so you live 7 years, it goes outside the estate, but they then have a pension at an early age, and basically they can't… don't forget, they can't get at it until Yes. 58, as it were, so if you think you want to have a real long-term planning scenario. Yeah. You can do that. And you can also do a junior ISA, which is 9 grand. So, if you wanted to have a little, you know, as some grandparents do, and they go, right, how many grandchildren I got? I'm going to give 10 grand to each grandchild. They go, right, I'll… Some of it goes into the ISA, because then that's flexible, they can… they can touch it when they're past 18, and that puts some money into a pension. That sorts that whole thing out, and then that's outside the estate, and you know, you know, basically, that's a good thing for them. And they can't touch it for a period of time." (Page 23), "George Williams: So, he invested $80,000…. Yep. in March 2018, And I think that was split between myself and Alison's account. Okay. And then he invested a further $19,000. George Williams: on the 8th of April, 2021. Okay, so we've got $80,000 for 7 years, and we've got $19,000 for 4 years." (Page 11)
Value: George Williams's primary investment portfolio is with Saltus, which has shown a 7.6% return over the last year and a 21% return over the past 3 years. He also holds funds with Investec, currently yielding 3.6%. George's pension pot is valued at £1.2 million to £1.3 million, and his wife Alison has a pension pot of £80,000 to £90,000 with TPT, which has recently experienced system transfer issues. Clive recommended exploring the Raisin platform for competitive savings rates, noting that Aldermere offers 4.29% and Shawbrook offers 4.26% for easy access accounts. He emphasized that these accounts, including those from providers like Alryan Bank, are protected up to £85,000 under the FSA compensation scheme. George previously invested $80,000 for his son Gareth in March 2018 and an additional $19,000 in April 2021, split between his and Alison's accounts, for which he requires a current valuation. As part of Inheritance Tax planning, discussions included making pension contributions for grandchildren (up to £3,600 per year, which gets 20% tax relief and costs £2,880) and utilizing Junior ISAs (with an annual allowance of £9,000) as a way to gift money outside the estate.

Evidence: "clive.martin: Or C, no, I want to make sure that the government gets as little money as possible. I think I tend to go on C, really. That's… you know, I don't want the government to get my money, but there again, you know… We haven't got a massive… expenditure wish list, or whatever. That hasn't changed. So, yes, I want to spend more on the money that I've got now. I'd like to get it to my children now, if I could. In some method, to make sure we have enough money. So, the things that I always think, I'm going to get to a stage Maybe, maybe not, I don't know. Let's say… in another 15 years' time, or wherever 20 years' time, where I'm going, well, Mum and Dad, you've got to go into a home. You know, the cost of that is, I've always said, the million pounds in the house will cover that, I would think. I would hope it would, because the average life span of someone going into a home, I know, is… is less than 4 years. It is. So, you know, I've calculated that out and got, well, that… that will cover us for a home for that period. So the money. So that then leaves about, you know, two… two… two… 2.7 million to get rid of, somehow. Without the taxman getting hold of it. Per se. Now, it might be that I pop my clogs next year, and Alison does as well, or whatever. … Cool. You don't know, you can't…. you need a crystal ball, and I'm not sure if anyone's got any one of those. But I would like to… if there was a way of being able to say, actually, I could do… you know, you read about these trusts or stuff, and then you're the people that are being caught by them, or whatever, or leaving your house in a deed for someone else, and the children get caught with a tax implication, as we did with Alison's mothers. et cetera, et cetera. Well, I'd like to find… I know that I can give the money to the kids at the moment, and I do, and point of fact, I give more than, I think, seven grand or whatever it is at the moment to them. But my view is they're such small amounts that, you know, no one declares it, and I don't think anyone can find out, really, unless the taxman comes along and says, oh, let's have a look at his account. Well, my ears are slightly shutting at those comments, but, so…. I know. Let's be black and white, but the, … a pet is basically you should live 7 years, so you live 7 years in regards to that. And if… if in the event that, on your death, that the HMRC are worried about it, they can go back into your situation, and then they can… they can dig everything up. Yeah. So, … I will perhaps send you a form that you can look at if you want to record this on a regular basis, because I'll show you. If you've got income versus expenditure rules, where you've got more income than expenditure, you can gift that money out on a monthly basis, or over the year, and that is automatically outside your estate. But you need to record it, because if someone comes back in and says. You know. what the hell was that? Then you need to prove it, otherwise it'll go back into the estate, and you might get, you know. But also from the point of view, if you don't live the 7 years. So, one should be, right now, more… Than ever, to be clear, because they'll have the ability to check the accounts. So, that's one. I think one of the, … There's some simple stuff. that I think people should consider. But before, before I do that, what do you think your general expenditure is, then? If you're being conservative and say, well, I want to have a certain amount of income to enjoy, what do you reckon the number is, in terms of your point of view? I don't know, actually, to be honest. What would you say you're spending now? You said Alison's spending about 1500 quid a month. And you're spending about, …. Yeah, I mean…. Well, you must be spending roughly about 50, aren't you? Yes. I was gonna say 50. I would think, between us. We've got an annual expenditure of between… Yeah, 60 to 70, I would think, with the other bits and pieces. But then, on top of that, you know, we draw down maybe 10, 15K for holidays or other bits and pieces like that, new, whatever. No, no, so, so, so, … I was ver… so, I would… I would think that, basically, you should probably be thinking about $85,000 a year, which is $70,000, what I call day-to-day expenditures, and gives you 15 grand for a float for holidays and stuff like that. Yeah. Does that seem fair? Yeah. So then… and then you get into the sort of more brutal camp thought process. Well, how long am I going to live for? Right? I know. And if you take the normal average, so you might, you might, as one client said to me, I'm way above average, I'm going to live way, way beyond the average. I said, fine, then you should plan on that basis, but as a starting point. So, … Married men are 86, and married women are 89 at the moment, roughly, according to the statistics. Really? Yeah, as a… as a… as a number. It's only an average, so, you know, obviously some people, you know, we've got the woman who's living, who's 116 today, so, you know, there's quite a… quite a wide scope. But clearly, part of that is that data includes COVID, and obviously a lot of people died in COVID. So, you know, so that has an impact, but… So, if you took whatever figure we worked on. So if we said 85,000, and then we… and then we multiplied, You're… 72? Yeah. Okay, so if we took… if we took, … Sorry, 85,000. And we took 20 years, that takes you to 92. So that gives you a bit more on the upside. … So you need £1.7 million worth of assets. A big cup. about it. Over that 20 years. Yeah. Now… … This is why you need to have a sort of chew over in your own mind, you think whether this sort of makes sense. So, 85,000, … … Divided by 2 sixths. So if you took $85,000 out, that's about 3.2% of your pot. Right, okay. So, if you're looking at… So, we work on a figure that, if you're talking about an income, if you look at a 4% figure. Has been conservative long-term asset returns of assets, and if we're in a balanced portfolio, we're trying to make 5, so there's another better than 1% buffer in regards to that. So you're below the 4%, so… As a starting point. That would mean if you took that $85,000 out. Each year, and we made 4%. You'd have all that money still there, plus a bit more. In 20 years' time. Yeah, I think you always said that when we first started this conversation off some 15, 20 years ago, about how much I'd have left when we, you know, if you carried on taking this amount. George Williams: And even now, I still look at the pension pot, and I go, it's exactly the same as it was, like. George Williams: 10 years ago, 1.3 million, or 1.2 million. It's exactly the same. So, so… What that basically says is there's probably a bit of… there's a bit of, freedom in terms of stuff that even if you… as you know. you spend more money in the first 10, 10, 15 years, it then flattens out, and then it starts coming down. So the reality is, if you're building a buffer, you're probably not going to be spending that in 5-10 years' time. Yeah, yeah. … And don't forget, obviously, you review each year anyway, so, but on the basis of that. And you've already got to… so… You've still got, in our view, 900,000 above the level you think you probably need. Yeah. But… That's just the start… this is what… this is what I mean about… this is just a starting figure. Now, the question is, is that still there? Paying $1.2 million. Of the whole thing. So if you did nothing, and it carried on growing in another 20 years. The likelihood is that that bill's likely to go up slightly over time. Because your other assets will have gone up as well, so, … The bill's likely to get bigger. So, I would say to clients. if you're comfortable with your number being good, and, you know, $85,000 as a starting point, I think is a reasonable go at it. That's not say you can't change your mind at any point, by the way, you're not locked into the 20 years, you can only take 85 grand back, and that would be silly." (Page 14-17)
Value: George Williams currently gifts money to his children, exceeding the annual £3,000 allowance, but he does not formally declare these gifts. He is keen to implement strategies to reduce his Inheritance Tax (IHT) liability, expressing a strong desire to ensure the government receives "as little money as possible." Proposed strategies include: utilizing Potentially Exempt Transfers (PETs) with a 7-year survival rule; formally recording gifts from surplus income/expenditure; establishing a discretionary trust with the £325,000 nil rate band; considering a whole-of-life insurance policy to cover £200,000-£250,000 of the IHT bill; and potentially using pensions for grandchildren (up to £3,600/year with 20% tax relief, treated as a PET) and Junior ISAs (£9,000/year).

(Page 14-17), "clive.martin: Now… The next one, you talked about trust, and you had that sort of skeptical look about, or trust the bloody complicated, they've all gone horribly wrong. So there are, there are, … have you heard or ever thought about a thing called a discretionary trust? No, I'm not… I've not really looked into trusts at all, to be honest. I've just heard some horrible things that's happened with trusts, that's all. Okay. Because the law changes quite rapidly, and all of a sudden, you know, you get caught by this trust or that trust, and saying, well, no, we can't pay that out. Or, in terms of what Alison had with, you know, the interest on the house that her mother and father had left them in trust, okay? We were paying something like 55% tax on the interest that it had gained, which was shedloads of money at the end of the day. Yeah, property is a completely separate issue, and I… and I, you know, my own… my own view on that, I don't think you can do anything really, I think, proper and sensible, boring financial planning on housing. I think that's a bit tricky, but… … The nil rate band, your 325,000 nil rate band, which you can use in the event of death to offset some of the, bill, you could set up a discretionary trust using a nil rate band today. So you place $325,000 in a discretionary trust. A discretionary trust is what it means, is that you and Alison will be the trustees. And you are the only people who can decide where that money goes. Right, okay. Now, the reason why I think that might be more appropriate for you is because you've got a classic family situation, which, only you will be able to have a better judgment on, and you've already said one thing, you said, well, I can't afford to… help them out on the school fees for that one, and then, because I won't be able to help. So the issue is, you might say, well, at the end of the day, I want to give A number to each grandchild, or or family, so that it's equal. What they then do with that money is completely up to them. Right, okay. Does that make sense? Yeah. But you decide where it is. And if… and if one of them said, I want to come… can I… can I have 30 grand from the trust dad to buy a Porsche, you can say no. If you can say someone like, you know, he's going on a rugby tour to Canada, and you go, how much it is, can I come with you? one of those. So, … Now, that $325,000, if it lasts for 7 years, you last for 7 years, so that's… that's sec… that's, … if you did that, then that is completely outside your estate. Okay. So you say 325 times times 40%. Is that making in that trust, is that making money at the same time? George, I could almost… That was the next question I thought you might ask me. If you invest in the same portfolio that you've been in for a long period of time, so you can do the same thing, so the trust can grow as well. So, if… if basically, over the… over a 7-year period, and I'm… I'm using this for simple math, if it doubles and turns into 650, The trust is then worth $650, and you can… that can all go to… And that's also outside of your estate. Right, and in terms of drawing it out, you can decide, I can decide, or if it's obviously Alison and I can decide. Where it can go to, and what it could be spent on. Who it goes to, how much, and what they're doing it. Okay. Well, that makes… that makes sense, yeah. Is there a catch? Well, there's… look, I've told you, there's no perfect world. Yeah. Let me talk about the sort of things that you need to consider. … After 10 years. So the trust is still going after 10 years. The profit from the money that you've invested So, anything that's grown above the 325 is taxed at 6%. At how much? 6%. 6. Fix. Okay. Okay. And that money can then be taken out of that trust and paid out, within that. So it's… compared to 40% to 6%, it's a pretty good deal. Yes, very good deal. So, but there… but there is… but there is that… there is that taxation issue. Now… This is where it gets really, really complicated. If after 7 years, you've lived 7 years. Then you can actually, anyone believes this, set up another one. Right. And using the white band again. Right. But once that… once that money's in that trust, that's it. You could… You can't take it out and reinvest it with you, because it's in a trust fund for…. You know, so the trust is just a document, and we would carry on looking after the investment of the… Okay? That money is not legally yours. Oh, I don't like that. No, go on. Yeah, but it's not…. But, thoughts, but, but, but… So, if, what a lot of people… if, let's say, we did all this lovely little homework, and we said, you need $85,000, by the end of it, it's suddenly, oh, shit, I need a lot more. … Discretionary trusts can pay the beneficiaries, which could be your children, or your grandchildren. And they could then pay If you have to go into a home, for example, and there was… there was more money required, because it then is their money, and if they wanted to pay their… your bill for… they could do that. … If you wanted to take them all on holiday. And the trust did quite well, you could pay them the money, and then the trust… the beneficiaries could then pay the whole debt with the trust money. So you are still paying for it, but it's just been around, and you've capped off that growth of it, and it's carried on growing. The only issue is, I've got enough money in my mind that I'm… I'm gonna be okay, Governor. I've still got my $85,000 for 20 years, that's… I've worked out 1.7, so I've still got I've still got some money left over. So, just one question, Clive. Could we take that, let's say, $150 from Al, 150 from myself, or whatever it is, and shove in there? Yeah, you could. It doesn't matter where the money comes from, but in reality. The reason why, the maximum you can do is a nil rate band. Yeah. If you could afford a nilrate band, it's the 325 where the money comes from, doesn't matter. Okay. Alright. … And then, obviously, if you keep reviewing each year, depending on how the funds are doing. You know, so if the funds were growing more on the rest of your stuff within Solstice, i.e. the thing was catching back up again, even though… then you can always, you know. Gift that a bit more. So you'll keep reviewing it each year, but you start off with You buy some life cover, that gives you something like $200,000, $250,000. Then you've got $325,000, so that's $500,000. Just on those two things. So, on the… going back to the life cover, how much does that cost? Well, that would depend on, on, two factors. Your age and your health. And obviously, what we do is simply… I can easily do it, I'm doing it… I'm doing it every day at the moment. Okay. Get you a quote for a number, and then you can see whether you think, oh, that's far too expensive, or that seems really reasonable, whatever. But I think… As a combination, you add those, just doing those two things, That's almost halving the bill. Yeah. No, I say that. So, 3 to 5… You're… you are losing it, but you're… you're still in control of it. You can still spend it. The trust can still spend it, but obviously it's the beneficiaries who have to spend it. Yeah. So, it'll be… it's completely up to you who they are. Yeah. So, that's…. Yeah, so my beneficiaries could well be… Yeah, my son, my daughter, and my grandchildren. Well, I mean, I'm going to say the obvious thing, depending on the age of the children and so forth, but, By skipping two generations. Yeah? That's proper financial planning. Because if… And again, this is where… this is where it becomes important, and this is where you come important in terms of where you choose it. If you think… Gareth doesn't need the money. Yeah. But it's useful for the grandchildren. You might want to give the money to the grandchildren. If your daughter, however, needs the money for her. Helping out with the kids, you might want to give it to her. That's the whole point of a discretionary, and only you will know how that… how that fits. Right, so we can put them in there for it, but do you have to decide when you do this discretionary trust? that they all get the equal amounts, or can it be, again, discretionary about, actually, I want to give them that amount, and her that amount? That's why it's called a discretionary trust. That's what… that's why… sorry, I was just wanting qualification on that, yeah. And that's why, in your particular case. Look, you can do a thing called a bear trust, which is simply, I'm… It's 50 grand for one of my grandchildren, but it… once it's absolutely… it can't change. I don't think you want that, and should need that. I think you should want to have that full discretionary in regards to that process. Yeah. Yeah. But you can't get to that point, should I do it, until you're happy with The first thought process is, well. if 85 grand… if 85 grand's a starting point, and I multiply that by 20, and I've still got my 1.7 million. Why do I need this extra bits? Okay. Now, so, … And there are other stuff that you can look at, which is… which is, … More risky in the sense of investment stuff, but you can do business relief. Up to a million quid a year, which, if you invest in it, and you last two years, it's 100% outside your estate. But that's more for people who Perhaps got maybe a bit more, or are slightly older, who've only got a short period of time to live, and that's the only way around getting the money out of the estate. I think, if you did those two things, and you did some income and expenditure and some potential gifts outright. … You know, just on those two, two things at $250 and a 3, you've halved the bill. Almost half of the bill. Without… without actually… the only costing is basically… is your slightly excess pain for the life cover. So, just… sorry, I'm just a little bit… reiterate for me how the life cover actually works again. So, I pay a premium. Yeah, you pay a premium, and let's call it 500 quid a month, let's just come up with a number. So it's 6 grand a year, and you live 20 years, that's what you… you'd have paid out 120 grand in terms of, of premiums. And it will pay out $250,000 in terms of… on death. Right, okay. Okay. So do you do it for a period of time, or is it once it's set up, that's it? that's what a whole of life is a whole of life until you… the second die… person dies. So you carry on paying that premium for that… for that length of time. So if you both got killed in a car crash the second month. You'll have paid one premium, and $250,000 would be paid. But if I live for another 20 years. For 20 years, we've paid out £120,000 in premiums, but you're still getting £250,000 on debt. So your break-even point, you'd have to live probably 40 years. Okay, I'm with it, I'm with it, with it. Yeah, I… I… I understand. And the reason why you look at both. as a combination, why I think it's useful. It's because you don't know how long you're gonna live for. No. Question, is that done on both of our lives, or is that done on…. No, it's done both of your lives. So what… and when does that… So if, if let's say…. I died first. Yep. Does… does that mature at that point, or…? No, no, so it only pays out on the second death, so you keep paying the premiums on the second death. So, so… Would the premium then reduce, or not? No, it would still be the same? No. Okay, alright, that just… yeah, fine. No, I understand. Okay. But… but ultimately, You've got two simple decisions to make that are complicated to agree on. Is $85,000 is a good starting point for the next 20 years, and you have all that money, … We know the mass is 1.7 million. So, if that figure is good in your mind, then you know you're going to have some surplus. So, all I… all I'm saying is, on that basis, if we just start with this, you've got 900 surplus. If you took 325 out, and you do some life covers on the side, you've still got about 600,000 left. And you then got 20 years, to… decrease the, the bill. In simple terms, I mean, you'll spend a bit more money. Or gifted out, depending on how you want to do it. Right, okay. Yeah. Fine. So you said 5 points. I think that was 4. Okay, so, so, we talked about the business tax relief, the one you can do for 2 years. Yeah. You can go up to a million quid, so that's, that's another option. And then you've got AIM, the AIM Index. Right. Which is… which is basically smaller, smaller companies, and you invest in that, and after 2 years, you've got a 50% relief. So you put 100 grand in, 50 grand is automatic outside your estate after 2 years. Right, okay." (Page 18-22), "clive.martin: Yeah, well, look… If you're… if you're… you could pay a pension contribution for your grandchildren. Yeah. They can do $3,600, you get 20% relief on the contribution, so any cost $2,880. Yeah. That's considered a pet, so you live 7 years, it goes outside the estate, but they then have a pension at an early age, and basically they can't… don't forget, they can't get at it until Yes. 58, as it were, so if you think you want to have a real long-term planning scenario. Yeah. You can do that. And you can also do a junior ISA, which is 9 grand. So, if you wanted to have a little, you know, as some grandparents do, and they go, right, how many grandchildren I got? I'm going to give 10 grand to each grandchild. They go, right, I'll… Some of it goes into the ISA, because then that's flexible, they can… they can touch it when they're past 18, and that puts some money into a pension. That sorts that whole thing out, and then that's outside the estate, and you know, you know, basically, that's a good thing for them. And they can't touch it for a period of time." (Page 23), "George Williams: It is. I like that discussion, Ritas, and the life cover. I'm not so keen on that, but I can see the benefit of that, and absolutely, as you say, you get the money back. easily over 50%, plus. Okay." (Page 24)
Value: George Williams' total estate, valued at £3.7 million (including £2.7 million in investments and a £1 million property), faces an Inheritance Tax (IHT) liability of £1.2 million (40% of the estate after the £650,000 nil rate band). George wants to minimize this IHT and actively pass wealth to his children. Current gifting involves George giving more than £3,000 annually, but he does not record it, which Clive advises against, explaining that Potentially Exempt Transfers (PETs) require a 7-year survival period to be outside the estate, and HMRC can investigate if not recorded.
Key strategies discussed for IHT mitigation include:
1. Gifting from surplus income and expenditure: This allows money to be outside the estate immediately if properly documented.
2. Life Cover: A whole-of-life policy on joint lives, paying out on the second death, is suggested with a sum assured of £200,000-£250,000. Premiums, estimated at £500 per month or £6,000 per year, would be paid until the second death, and the policy can be canceled at any time. This, combined with a discretionary trust, could effectively halve the IHT bill.
3. Discretionary Trust: A discretionary trust can be established with the £325,000 nil rate band, removing this amount from the estate after 7 years. The trust can invest and grow, with any profit above the initial £325,000 taxed at 6% after 10 years, a significant reduction from the 40% IHT rate. George and Alison would be trustees, controlling who (children, grandchildren) receives distributions and in what amounts, offering flexibility to address varying family needs like school fees or house deposits. Another trust can be established after 7 years.
4. Business Relief: Investing up to £1 million per year in business relief qualifying assets provides 100% IHT relief after 2 years.
5. AIM Index Investments: Investing in AIM Index companies offers 50% IHT relief after 2 years.
6. Property Downsizing: Downsizing their £1 million home could release capital for gifting or other IHT strategies.
7. Pensions for Grandchildren: Contributing £3,600 per year to a pension for each of the five grandchildren, benefiting from 20% tax relief (actual cost £2,880). These contributions are treated as PETs after 7 years and are inaccessible until age 58, promoting long-term financial planning.
8. Junior ISAs: Using Junior ISAs for grandchildren, with an annual allowance of £9,000, offers flexible savings accessible at age 18.
Clive emphasized the importance of considering these strategies before the budget (end of October) due to potential changes in IHT rules by a Labour government. He also mentioned that the SIP (Self-Invested Pension) is allegedly due to be included in estates by 2027, although this is subject to consultation and may be postponed until 2028.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.180
clive.martin: George.

2
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.619
George Williams: How are you?

3
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.619
clive.martin: I'm okay, I'm okay. … I just, …

4
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:31.180
clive.martin: I will start off with, I'm sorry if you felt I didn't, didn't, reply and such. I think…

5
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.910
clive.martin: … I looked it up, … I had a, …

6
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.460
clive.martin: What's the word I'm looking for?

7
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:47.230
clive.martin: I had a fall on holiday in, in, … In… where was I?

8
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:48.589
clive.martin: I was in Portugal.

9
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.879
clive.martin: And, … Bash, bash my head.

10
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.959
clive.martin: And everyone thought, you know, I was… I was dying, and my heart was going on something, or blah blah blah, that sort of stuff.

11
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.380
clive.martin: They wouldn't let me fly.

12
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.570
clive.martin: And, so I stepped down in hospital.

13
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:11.469
clive.martin: And anyway, I came back, and then I went to see the specialist, and, had to do all these tests.

14
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.969
clive.martin: And, … Which is quite interesting. Obviously, …

15
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.149
clive.martin: Then came back after all the tests, and the guy said, you had your best results you've had the last 4 years.

16
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.710
George Williams: Ugh.

17
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.189
clive.martin: So you're no longer diabetic too, you're, …

18
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.380
clive.martin: what's he called? I call all those other things, they test.

19
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.949
George Williams: Pretty diabetic.

20
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.999
clive.martin: So I'm below pre-diabetic now, so that's interesting.

21
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:48.320
clive.martin: And my blood pressure had gone down quite a lot, and my cholesterol which was…

22
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.590
clive.martin: I think it was at 3.

23
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:59.369
clive.martin: is now at 2, and 1.7 is, sort of, Olympic standard. Yeah. So I'm thinking, well, that's interesting.

24
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.310
clive.martin: I mean, I had lost 2 stone in the 6 months taking some pills.

25
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.860
clive.martin: For the diabet… diabetes and stuff.

26
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.280
clive.martin: Which is a bit weird, but anyway. So…

27
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.710
clive.martin: they were a bit worried, so I had…

28
00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.559
clive.martin: I think 3 weeks when I perhaps wasn't, perhaps, at my best.

29
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.870
clive.martin: Thinking about all these sort of things. So, I, …

30
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.149
clive.martin: I apologize if I didn't, ….

31
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:37.460
George Williams: Now, I… I… it's not like you, Clive, and I just wondered what was up, because normally you'd get back to me, or say something, or whatever, and it was just, like, all quiet under the Western Front, and I went.

32
00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:53.290
clive.martin: Well, I was obviously very… so I don't know whether I missed… I went through a whole checklist, but I mean, luckily it's pretty easy to do now, checking all those things, so I apologize, because I was also slightly confused, because…

33
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.080
clive.martin: Your son emailed me.

34
00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.510
George Williams: Yes, that's right.

35
00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:06.140
clive.martin: So I didn't know… I didn't know what to say to him, what you said to him, so I was a bit like, okay, I better speak to George first, in regards to that.

36
00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.060
George Williams: Yeah, no, that's fine. I mean, I think.

37
00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:15.790
clive.martin: just… I think he was just introducing himself, Clive. Yeah, but I didn't know whether, that was….

38
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:23.260
George Williams: you told him, like, we'll get together, and I was thinking, okay, well, I better have a conversation first, blah blah blah. Yes, no, absolutely.

39
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:32.089
clive.martin: I don't know, I don't know where… don't know where we are. And I think then… then the second time, as soon as I come back, the world seems to sort of explode it into sort of,

40
00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:44.260
clive.martin: thought process, and God knows what else has come. So, supposedly the quiet time in summer has exploded into sort of a potpourri of a whole lot of different issues.

41
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:50.550
George Williams: Yeah, and Solter seemed to be suffering from IT issues at the moment with one of their suppliers.

42
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.400
clive.martin: So, that, that has also not helped in the last, ….

43
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.530
George Williams: you can imagine.

44
00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.130
clive.martin: And … I mean.

45
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:10.330
clive.martin: I'm probably the worst person to talk about this stuff, because I'm far too transparent, but, …

46
00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:17.779
clive.martin: It seems to me that In the great world of data and all this stuff.

47
00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:21.209
clive.martin: If someone attacks you, cyber attacks you.

48
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:24.250
clive.martin: The main defense of what you do is you switch it off.

49
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:25.200
George Williams: Yeah.

50
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:27.490
George Williams: I know.

51
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.019
clive.martin: Which… which seems to me a bit weird, because

52
00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.480
clive.martin: When it's switched off, if it doesn't work, then people will think, well, what's…

53
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:42.960
clive.martin: what's wrong, unless… until they work out if they… so they… so they basically switched it off. I mean, …

54
00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.500
clive.martin: It's interesting because there are lots of other big providers in the same position.

55
00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:49.850
George Williams: Oh, really?

56
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.410
clive.martin: Well, I mean… It's… Yeah.

57
00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.890
clive.martin: Pantander, HSBC, you know, the whole….

58
00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.280
George Williams: Yeah, the whole one.

59
00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:09.739
clive.martin: It's not, … But, … The great thing is no… there's no data, there's no risk, except… except….

60
00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.009
George Williams: No, I've read it from the MD.

61
00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:24.350
clive.martin: Well, I'll add them along. But in essence, and it was typical, because basically the price didn't move, and of course the market went up the week that it did it. So.

62
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:34.569
clive.martin: So I was hoping in my… and as I said to them, well, if it goes back on, then it's gone up, everyone's fund's gone up by 1%, they won't care.

63
00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:35.950
George Williams: No.

64
00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:40.930
clive.martin: But if they've gone down by 5%, then that might be a bit of a different issue.

65
00:05:41.440 --> 00:06:02.129
George Williams: Yeah, I mean, for people like myself, it doesn't really matter, because, you know, I turn… I go on there maybe once a month and look at, where are we now? Oh, that's good, you know, it's gone up by that much, or it's gone down by that much. So, it doesn't really worry me that much, but I can imagine there must be a lot of people out there that actually

66
00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.130
George Williams: manage their portfolio a lot closer than, sort of.

67
00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:12.999
clive.martin: Well, I mean, to be honest, we're… I mean, we don't have many clients who do that.

68
00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:14.210
George Williams: Right, okay.

69
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.230
clive.martin: Well… simply because….

70
00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:21.639
George Williams: the whole purpose of coming to someone like ourselves is that….

71
00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:30.530
clive.martin: So, if, you know, ultimately, at the end of the day, if you can see what it's doing all the time, if you want to, that's what a lot of people want to be able to switch on.

72
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:44.580
clive.martin: Two, if there's an issue in regards to performance, then obviously there's someone to talk to in regards to that, and blah blah blah, and of course, we've got all the stuff, you know. You probably, you know, I don't know, don't know how you feel, but, …

73
00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:55.999
clive.martin: we over-egg information. We've got all that information on the portal, we've got, you know, the quarterly reports. I mean, there is no way people don't know how it's doing, good or bad.

74
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:56.500
George Williams: Right.

75
00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:06.259
clive.martin: So, you know, in some respects, that hopefully is calming. We think that's a calming effect over time. And if, I mean, go back to COVID…

76
00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:11.839
clive.martin: You know, we wrote a letter every month to say it has to get it's gone down by a bit more, blah blah blah, but…

77
00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:16.490
clive.martin: Interestingly enough, the best feedback we ever got Was that people thought.

78
00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:21.570
clive.martin: Well, they're just telling me all the time, and people are saying, well, no one else is writing to me.

79
00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:28.800
clive.martin: It's like, why aren't they writing to me? And… and you guys at Salted are, like, churning out paperwork every week.

80
00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:29.929
George Williams: That's right.

81
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:35.079
clive.martin: We, we think, we think it's a good idea, but look, it, it, …

82
00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:47.710
clive.martin: in the modern world, as you, you know, when everything… everyone says, well, you should go digital, young man, you know, everything, you know, and speed of… of information is, you know, everyone wants it faster and faster. Well.

83
00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:52.710
clive.martin: Trouble is, if someone cuts it off, or whatever, then it does have a slight problem.

84
00:07:53.700 --> 00:08:11.469
George Williams: It has… it has a… and I mean, yeah, I mean, I was in it, as you know, for years, and it is… from what I can see now, it's getting more dangerous with AI and with what's happening in the marketplace, how people are going to actually

85
00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:14.680
George Williams: secure their data.

86
00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:33.669
George Williams: from certain elements of, scammers and whatever, I just find it ridiculous. You know, sometimes you go back to the old days, you had POW notes, and unless you were robbed, that was it. Your money was safe. Unfortunately, nowadays, it's just all up there in the cloud.

87
00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:44.609
George Williams: And people get access to it. I don't care how good some of these people are, there's a better hacker somewhere that will get through the firewall, that will get through somewhere. It's… it's quite worrying.

88
00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:51.360
clive.martin: Well, to a certain extent, that's true, and I think, I think, you know.

89
00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:58.360
clive.martin: between Yumi and the Gatepost, we're investing quite a lot in cyber security companies, because of that reason, because obviously….

90
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.040
George Williams: Have to. Yeah, have to.

91
00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:10.760
clive.martin: You have to. But I think, obviously, this is a third party, and this is just a stream of information of the data updating every day, the units and stuff. Yeah.

92
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:12.979
clive.martin: But it is an interesting test.

93
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.469
clive.martin: I mean, this is the way I look at it. So.

94
00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:26.300
clive.martin: if they had got in, or they were worried about people getting in, and it got shut down, then they… they… there's no data lost in anything, so that's good. You can't lose any money, because it just means that…

95
00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:36.330
clive.martin: So… and they are… they're the first port of call. So, obviously, if they… if they try to get into us, we've got ours as well, so… and the platforms, but… so it's got 3 levels to go through.

96
00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:38.140
George Williams: Yeah, that's right.

97
00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:46.009
clive.martin: But this… but this… so, in some respects, you know, because I'm in the same position as you, because I got the money in the company as well.

98
00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:50.659
George Williams: Oh, you have? Oh, that's good to hear!

99
00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:54.699
clive.martin: So, I'm thinking exactly the same way as a client, hopefully, would think.

100
00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:58.420
clive.martin: … So they can't get that information, so…

101
00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:01.620
clive.martin: In some respects, it's good, because the system's been tested.

102
00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:06.090
clive.martin: … There's a… there's a… there's a few obvious issues.

103
00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:15.969
clive.martin: Which is always about third-party risk being completely transparent. But we've decided, rightly or wrongly, that if there are any… someone who, you know.

104
00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:21.339
clive.martin: Someone… was sadly having to Buy a house or something, and….

105
00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:21.930
George Williams: Yes.

106
00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:25.979
clive.martin: needed the money and all that sort of stuff. So, we've done all the…

107
00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.359
clive.martin: All the stuff to get money away who's…

108
00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:32.320
clive.martin: clients are needed urgently. And conversely, …

109
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:38.539
clive.martin: the money that's come in, which trains enough, we've got quite a lot of money coming in. Obviously, we can't invest it.

110
00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:48.600
clive.martin: And we'll have to work out, but we will make that difference up, and then we have to go back to the cyber security insurance being a third party. But… but what we've decided to basically do… so…

111
00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:52.329
clive.martin: Horrible as it sounds, it's actually probably a good test.

112
00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:56.120
George Williams: Yes, it's all safe, yeah.

113
00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:05.919
clive.martin: But, if I'm being really honest, doing a real test in the summer when most people are on a holiday, probably not so many people got… got so upset about it.

114
00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.979
clive.martin: Yeah. You know, the ones who needed money.

115
00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:13.570
clive.martin: So I had… I had 3 clients who were getting some money, and one was building a…

116
00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:20.880
clive.martin: house, and they needed money on a regular thing for the next 3 months or something. That, you know, she would have been in real trouble with the builder if she couldn't, you know.

117
00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:21.510
George Williams: Yes.

118
00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:33.479
clive.martin: So, so, so there's always going to be some, but in reality, all the regular stuff's still going to get paid out and all that. So, you know, from that point of view, that's… that's not an issue. So, ….

119
00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:38.649
George Williams: Yeah, it doesn't… it didn't worry me, it was just interesting to read about it, so….

120
00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:44.559
clive.martin: Well, I think the other thing about it is, again, clients say, well, God, you're writing to us every day.

121
00:11:44.930 --> 00:12:02.899
clive.martin: well, because we take these things seriously, it's not, it's not as if, you know, and poor old Adam, he has a work weekend and all that sort of stuff, so I sent him a little note saying, just in case you don't know, someone does love you, apart from the clients, you know, we all do appreciate the work you're doing. He said.

122
00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:10.160
clive.martin: So, in the madness, it's nice to realize that some people does realize what work that we do. So, but, ….

123
00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:17.159
George Williams: He said, I think, in the last communication, that it should be fixed this week.

124
00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:21.549
clive.martin: Yeah, yeah, no, so, so, we're hoping that,

125
00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:26.759
clive.martin: Because, I mean, I'm preaching to the converted.

126
00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:36.430
clive.martin: So they think it'll get done, but we need to test that it is correct, and we need to check it. And then we've got to check it. I think Friday afternoon.

127
00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:44.710
clive.martin: will be the, the D-Day, so that things should be up to date. Right. Going into the weekend, clients will see

128
00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.750
clive.martin: Exactly where they are.

129
00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:49.910
George Williams: See an update of where we are, where it's showing at the moment.

130
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:50.480
clive.martin: But….

131
00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:56.490
George Williams: It might be Sod's Law, it went up last week by a percent, it might come down by a week….

132
00:12:56.490 --> 00:13:01.669
clive.martin: It's still the same bloody price, which would be rather ironic, but there we go.

133
00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:10.159
George Williams: That is quite good. I mean, I did have a quick review of the market, of the platform. Obviously, it's not completely up-to-date, but…

134
00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:26.990
George Williams: I mean, in the last year, the market, and my money, seems to have gone up a flying rate. It's… the market's done very well, considering the state of the economy and labor and everything else at the moment.

135
00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:35.599
clive.martin: Well, I think, I think, if… if I was being, comp… One of the…

136
00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.660
clive.martin: Challenges going forward in the next decade.

137
00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:45.120
clive.martin: Is… is actually trying to work out How you get diversity.

138
00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:49.510
clive.martin: You know, because… If you're having, you know.

139
00:13:49.700 --> 00:14:01.599
clive.martin: They're equities, but equities in general, I mean, yes, they're gross equities, and yes, there's some conservative equities, but if there's a crash, they all go down. It's a question about how much they go down by. Yeah.

140
00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:07.789
clive.martin: You know, the bond market is all taken into interest rates and inflation, so, you know.

141
00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:11.219
clive.martin: In general, most bomb markets around the world

142
00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:23.410
clive.martin: behave the same. I mean, they're probably not so much at the moment, but you probably know what they're going to do. So to try and get a different slant on things is quite tricky.

143
00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:27.510
clive.martin: If you, if you, if you have a… So…

144
00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:38.049
clive.martin: So I'm the commodity buff on the IM committee, so on the asset, so we've had our highest commodity exposure of all time.

145
00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:39.610
George Williams: Really?

146
00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:44.240
clive.martin: So, and at the moment, that commodity exposure has been gold and silver.

147
00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:50.209
clive.martin: So, if you… if you think about an average benchmark.

148
00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:54.519
clive.martin: Yes. Most people have 0% in gold and silver.

149
00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:57.310
George Williams: Okay.

150
00:14:57.690 --> 00:15:05.919
clive.martin: So, we have had approximately ranging between 4% to 10% in the gold and silver market in the last 3 years in the portfolio.

151
00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:09.920
clive.martin: And, gold's up 100%.

152
00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:11.450
clive.martin: So, is it….

153
00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:12.170
George Williams: Really?

154
00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:12.790
clive.martin: Yep.

155
00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:15.950
clive.martin: And gold has outperformed the S&P.

156
00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:19.820
clive.martin: It's up 28% this year, and silver's up about 30%.

157
00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.200
clive.martin: So unless you know about these things.

158
00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:23.890
George Williams: Yeah.

159
00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:26.269
clive.martin: You don't notice it, because no one has it.

160
00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:30.599
clive.martin: So you're a bit like the wolf, all on your own in the corner.

161
00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:36.690
clive.martin: the only time you notice it, if you have a big position in these, what I call…

162
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:39.540
clive.martin: Slightly different vehicles.

163
00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:45.180
clive.martin: It only matters if it basically goes the opposite way, because your diversification doesn't work.

164
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:47.480
George Williams: Right, okay, yeah, I'm good.

165
00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:54.410
clive.martin: … But we do think… that commodities are in a bull market for the next decade.

166
00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:56.750
George Williams: Oh, good.

167
00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:01.640
clive.martin: Now… The trouble about… the trouble about commodities…

168
00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:09.049
clive.martin: and much as I love commodities, they're smaller markets, they move quicker, and they're very volatile, both up and down.

169
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:10.780
clive.martin: So, yeah.

170
00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:13.890
clive.martin: You have to be careful about sizing the position.

171
00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:16.030
clive.martin: That makes sense. Yes, but no….

172
00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:18.570
George Williams: 100%, I understand, yeah, yeah.

173
00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:22.660
clive.martin: And also how you trade them, because, …

174
00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:32.980
clive.martin: It's… it's difficult, … so you can have stop losses in… to a certain extent, in… in… a portfolio.

175
00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:46.970
clive.martin: So if you had, you know, a massive amount of Apple shares, and you wanted to cut the position if it went through 220p, you could basically put a stop loss in there, and it all gets automatically sold. It's a bit harder to do that in the

176
00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:56.099
clive.martin: In the commodity market. So, we are very, very diversified, for a number of reasons. One is that,

177
00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:02.600
clive.martin: In general terms, the things that are… big capacity.

178
00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:06.840
clive.martin: AI build data centers.

179
00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:08.740
clive.martin: EVs.

180
00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:11.140
clive.martin: You need a hell of a lot of copper.

181
00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:14.600
George Williams: Yes, no, you're right, it is.

182
00:17:14.639 --> 00:17:15.479
clive.martin: It's….

183
00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:18.090
George Williams: And a lot of precious metals as well.

184
00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:22.190
clive.martin: So it takes about 10 years to… to find and build a…

185
00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:28.929
clive.martin: So you can't just turn the tattles, or I'd like to… I'd like to increase my copper, production by 300%, please.

186
00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:31.039
George Williams: It's not possible. It doesn't happen.

187
00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:37.569
clive.martin: And of course, the speed at which the EV market and those sort of things is adoption.

188
00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:44.380
clive.martin: You know, everyone… everyone knows it's going to get to there at some point, but no one knows the, you know, how it gets there.

189
00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:51.240
clive.martin: So, Norway, for example, is now, this year, 100% of its car sales are EVs.

190
00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:53.480
George Williams: Really?

191
00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:55.970
clive.martin: Now, that's… that's quite weird.

192
00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:59.299
clive.martin: you know, say that in the UK, and then we'll go, well…

193
00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:09.720
clive.martin: The only thing I want an EV car, because I'm not convinced I can fill it up further, how many out? You know, so that they're all… they're all going half what typical UK Conservative

194
00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:11.439
clive.martin: They're in the hybrid market.

195
00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:12.960
clive.martin: That's what's going on at the moment.

196
00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:20.750
George Williams: Hybrid market is booming, electrical market is down by something like 50% of what they predicted, or less.

197
00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:27.410
clive.martin: So, so… Each country has its own things, but it's all to do with the infrastructure.

198
00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:28.330
George Williams: Yeah.

199
00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:34.459
clive.martin: Because if you had, … If everyone could have an EV car and you could, you know.

200
00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:38.399
clive.martin: Plug it into your own home, and you all had solar panels.

201
00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:44.499
clive.martin: you know, you'll be… you'll be kids in. But of course, How long that's gonna take.

202
00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:58.940
George Williams: I think, though, Clive, yes, I agree with all that, but one of the biggest things that people are thinking about, and the conversation I'm having with people that are having exactly the same conversations as to why they don't want to buy an EV car.

203
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:05.139
George Williams: It's simply reason, is that the batteries are not there yet, and that a car

204
00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:08.570
George Williams: A, you have to pay more for an EV car at the moment.

205
00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:09.890
clive.martin: And B.

206
00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:25.889
George Williams: literally, you drive it off the forecourt, and the price of it drops through the bottom, because after about 5 or 6 years, you won't be able to sell it, because people will go, well, I've only got about another 4 years' life out of it. Now, that is changing.

207
00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:41.640
George Williams: But at the moment, the batteries are going, you know, they're… you know, after 10 years, you have to spend, like, thousands on new batteries. And at the moment, it does not make sense to buy an EV car.

208
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:44.450
clive.martin: I understand that logic.

209
00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.990
clive.martin: … It.

210
00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:51.779
clive.martin: It's pretty clear that If you're in the short journey world.

211
00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:53.670
George Williams: Yeah.

212
00:19:53.670 --> 00:20:00.600
clive.martin: then the EV is, like, because you save however much you save in terms of petrol and all those other stuff, so… so I think…

213
00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:08.820
clive.martin: 30-mile radius, if you're in and out of the, you know, it's quits in. As soon as you get past regular

214
00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:16.550
clive.martin: 50 mile… 50 miles every day type thing. I… I understand that. … …

215
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:23.190
clive.martin: the speed at which these things happen. So, … But the, … so…

216
00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:35.660
clive.martin: copper, gold, silver. Silver has been… this is going to be the fifth year of, decrease in terms of, production versus demand, so you, you know… Wow.

217
00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:40.139
clive.martin: So… And if you look at the subsection of all those

218
00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:43.690
clive.martin: Those little macro fights that are going on.

219
00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:45.080
George Williams: Yeah, you know.

220
00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:48.759
clive.martin: People… people… Why… why is Trump

221
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:53.530
clive.martin: wanting to get on with Ukraine is because it's got minerals.

222
00:20:53.530 --> 00:21:00.400
George Williams: Very many precious minerals there that he's already signing that agreement with them for.

223
00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:07.589
clive.martin: why is he… why does he not want to kill, China? Because they are the largest producers of those sort of things.

224
00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:12.749
clive.martin: So he doesn't want to be cut short, he wants to buy some time to basically stop producing and all that sort of stuff.

225
00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:13.250
George Williams: Yeah.

226
00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:16.649
clive.martin: So it's clear that we are in an economic war already.

227
00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:18.849
George Williams: Oh, gosh, massive, yeah.

228
00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:20.560
clive.martin: So, …

229
00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:26.859
clive.martin: Having those sort of stuff, and then if you run out, you can't… if you run out, you can't grow.

230
00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:29.040
George Williams: None.

231
00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:31.860
clive.martin: And then you think of all the other stuff that buys with it.

232
00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:34.410
clive.martin: With the platforms and stuff.

233
00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:36.049
clive.martin: And, …

234
00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:43.490
clive.martin: I was, I was, … what was the word I'd use? People were slightly gobsmacked when I said to them.

235
00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:44.620
clive.martin: …

236
00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:58.580
clive.martin: I'm now in my 60s, and this is the first time I can genuinely ask the question, is USA a capitalist country, or has it become a communist and left-wing party?

237
00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:02.259
clive.martin: And my reason and rationale for that is, first time ever.

238
00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:12.009
clive.martin: There's a company called MD Materials, which is basically the only mineral company in the US, based in Las Vegas.

239
00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:12.630
George Williams: Oh, right.

240
00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:14.299
clive.martin: And, …

241
00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:26.050
clive.martin: rather interesting, slow little headlines that never really got into the UK press, but obviously I'm a bit of a commodity nerd. The US government invested $400 million

242
00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:28.459
clive.martin: In… in shares in the company.

243
00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:29.840
George Williams: Wow.

244
00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:32.370
clive.martin: The following week, Apple

245
00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:41.170
clive.martin: Bought 500 million pounds worth of stock as well, because they want guaranteed supply for some of the minerals that they want for their phones.

246
00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:42.370
George Williams: Yeah?

247
00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:43.040
clive.martin: So…

248
00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:58.370
clive.martin: Did the government and Apple come to a nice little negotiation that basically has meant that that company has got the cap that needs to expand, and oh, and oh, and shit, oh, the share price went up 300% this year. Oh, that's interesting.

249
00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:02.340
George Williams: Well, yeah.

250
00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:03.520
George Williams: It is.

251
00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:08.410
clive.martin: They don't care, as long as they're getting the stuff.

252
00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:10.769
clive.martin: Yeah. That's the message that I'm getting.

253
00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:11.510
George Williams: Yeah.

254
00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:19.699
clive.martin: And therefore, they don't, you know, don't worry about rules about, you know, shares and, you know, all that sort of stuff, so it's very, very… and of course.

255
00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:21.720
clive.martin: this week.

256
00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:23.800
clive.martin: I'm doing something about Intel.

257
00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:30.389
clive.martin: That's the… over the… whatever the… whatever the acts that Biden did.

258
00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:43.369
clive.martin: 400 million, or whatever, no, it was a bit more than that, actually. And, they're saying, oh, no, we're not gonna… we're gonna buy… we're gonna buy… we're gonna have to buy some equities in Intel, and the profit is gonna go back to the US, …

259
00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:49.229
clive.martin: Just, … … In a central place where we'd keep all the money.

260
00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:56.330
clive.martin: So they're now… so now they're… now they're giving money, but they're taking the profit and giving it back. It's like, hello?

261
00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:00.610
clive.martin: That's communist behavior.

262
00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:03.210
George Williams: Yeah, it is.

263
00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:10.229
clive.martin: Well… Because if you said Donald Trump was a communist, you'd probably get a rather interesting hearing in the US.

264
00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:12.480
George Williams: You would.

265
00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:25.769
George Williams: Yeah, you have to… well, that's the problem with everything now, you have to be so careful what you say. You can't say a word out of place anywhere, otherwise to do good is it gonna fall on you like a ton of bloody…

266
00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:26.870
George Williams: Bricks.

267
00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:30.299
clive.martin: So, the world is definitely changing.

268
00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:34.330
clive.martin: And therefore, just going back to diversification, you have to…

269
00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:42.740
clive.martin: … decide on what diversification, how those diversification cases, you know. So, …

270
00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:47.440
clive.martin: You've got that weird thing with… European defense stocks.

271
00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:55.379
clive.martin: Now, for the first time, Europe is basically coughing up and going to spend some money, and they're up 150-200% this year.

272
00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:59.580
clive.martin: Because finally, Well, I mean, they've… they…

273
00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:07.100
clive.martin: not… they've not wanted to do all that sort of stuff. Now they've got no choice but cough up and pay for the defense of… against Russia.

274
00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:08.150
George Williams: Yeah….

275
00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:09.110
clive.martin: Yeah.

276
00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:17.470
clive.martin: So, part of the reason and rationale is that having that… But…

277
00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:20.869
clive.martin: There are still lots of people who get very scared.

278
00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:24.210
clive.martin: When they go climbing. This is so off-piste.

279
00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:28.720
clive.martin: our allocation in that area. I said, Well…

280
00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:31.780
clive.martin: To be honest, we've been underweight.

281
00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:35.570
clive.martin: And they look at me and go, what do you mean they were underweight? Well…

282
00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:38.490
clive.martin: It doesn't happen very often.

283
00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:44.910
clive.martin: So if you're in a cyclical bull market for commodities, then…

284
00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:49.389
clive.martin: If you're not in it, you… they get… they will go up 300%.

285
00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:54.959
clive.martin: And I said to him, you look at the last disaster.

286
00:25:55.140 --> 00:26:01.230
clive.martin: That people forget about. Do you remember crude oil, what crude oil got to in, in, in COVID?

287
00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:02.230
George Williams: Yes.

288
00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:04.600
clive.martin: It got to minus 10.

289
00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.279
George Williams: It was… yeah.

290
00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:08.290
clive.martin: So, basically.

291
00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:13.000
clive.martin: The world's dead, we don't need any oil, we're getting rid of it. We're gonna give it away.

292
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.860
George Williams: I know, it's weird, isn't it? It's just….

293
00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:19.730
clive.martin: And it went from minus 10…

294
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:32.149
clive.martin: 280. So I said… so I said to them, so what return am I getting? And some bright sparks that we can't work that out, because if you start with a minus, it never works out. I said, okay, we'll just deal… deal with naught then.

295
00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:36.300
George Williams: So….

296
00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:38.989
clive.martin: So these things are… But you…

297
00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:44.959
clive.martin: you've got to be… you've got to be in it to win it, as they say. So, it's…

298
00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:48.190
clive.martin: It's a fascinating time in the world, it's not…

299
00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:57.209
clive.martin: I don't think it's going to carry on being… being like that, but… but… but… In the sense that…

300
00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:02.770
clive.martin: We think it's going to be easier

301
00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:09.259
clive.martin: and I say this with trepidation, looking at your face, it's easier to make an okay return

302
00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:11.629
clive.martin: You know, in the 5% campaign.

303
00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:16.519
clive.martin: Then trying to make a lot of money, because you'd have to be…

304
00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:19.739
clive.martin: Either lucky, or you get your timing right in some of that stuff.

305
00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:24.269
clive.martin: You know, uranium's up 85% this year.

306
00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:25.360
George Williams: Yeah.

307
00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:30.410
clive.martin: … Who, who would say you'd have uranium in your portfolio?

308
00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:35.359
clive.martin: … Or, or nuclear energy. You know, if nuclear energy comes back.

309
00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:42.269
clive.martin: which it… which it probably will do as part of the whole thing, then that's gonna be. And then…

310
00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:47.810
clive.martin: We've actually got some carbon in our… in our portfolio. Carbon permits, I mean….

311
00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:48.200
George Williams: Really?

312
00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:51.679
clive.martin: That's really, you know, I mean, it's 0.5% of the portfolio.

313
00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:57.490
clive.martin: But if you said that to someone and went, oh, I've got carbon in my portfolio, they go, what the fuck do you want that for?

314
00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:58.970
George Williams: Why?

315
00:27:58.970 --> 00:27:59.495
clive.martin: What?

316
00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:02.940
clive.martin: And then, we will, at some point.

317
00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.449
clive.martin: Be able to have some…

318
00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:09.049
clive.martin: Bitcoin and all that sort of stuff, long and short, hopefully.

319
00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:10.450
George Williams: Yeah.

320
00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:15.900
clive.martin: Yeah. There's lots of little divers… so the world's… …

321
00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:25.820
clive.martin: In terms of that, but the most important thing is the clients are getting the returns they're expecting, and they're doing the things that they want to do with their money. That's… that's the way we always think about this stuff.

322
00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:26.970
George Williams: Yeah.

323
00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:31.770
clive.martin: But at the same time, we've got a very big position, some very low-risk stuff, like…

324
00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:34.139
clive.martin: Two, two, two-year bonds.

325
00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:38.859
clive.martin: And they're giving us, you know, 4% with no risk, unless the US government goes bust.

326
00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:40.990
George Williams: Yeah, yeah.

327
00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:41.850
clive.martin: I mean….

328
00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:55.000
George Williams: Yeah, I mean, it's funny enough, this week, all I've had is letters from Chantendere, Halifax, I mean, I haven't got lots of money with them or anything, just saying, you know, please note our interest rates have gone down.

329
00:28:55.370 --> 00:29:08.190
George Williams: And they're going down, seems like, everywhere at the moment. Yeah. So, I mean, I think the best I've got at the moment is 3.6 from Investec.

330
00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:12.069
George Williams: Which I think is still pretty good, actually. ….

331
00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:17.680
clive.martin: So, so… I think I've told you before about raisin.

332
00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:19.980
George Williams: Yes. Yeah.

333
00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:24.539
clive.martin: Well, if you looked on Raisin, if you've got your iPad there.

334
00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:25.320
George Williams: Yeah.

335
00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:36.199
clive.martin: Go on. Look under it now, Raisin, and look under flexible accounts. I think you'll find that some… still some good rates available, and you can still get some good fixed rates as well.

336
00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:40.140
George Williams: Really. It's really annoying, actually, because…

337
00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:53.930
George Williams: For some reason, the rugby club… I'm not in the finances side, but the rugby club had 14 grand, which it said, … well, it's just sitting in an account, this was last year, so we'll invest it in a bond, and I didn't look at it.

338
00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:59.980
George Williams: And they got the results back, and it was something like, you know, 2.5% from a fixed bond.

339
00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:18.080
George Williams: And I went, hang on a minute, you surely must have done better than that. And they just reinvested it again at about the same rate. And I said, well, I know you can get a lot better rate of interest from a lot of other companies on things like that, so I don't know who he was using or why he was using them.

340
00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:27.430
clive.martin: … Yeah, I mean… Hash management is also going to be quite important, I think, going forward.

341
00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:31.499
clive.martin: The big banks are basically cleaning up. They're just slashing rates.

342
00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:37.019
clive.martin: And they're making on the arbitrage, but some of these newer ones, where am I?

343
00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:39.420
George Williams: Savings accounts.

344
00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:48.040
George Williams: Yeah, 4.29% Aldermere.

345
00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:50.210
George Williams: 4.28.

346
00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:55.410
George Williams: 4.26… You get some good rates, can't you?

347
00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:59.390
George Williams: I've never heard of any of those, but there you go!

348
00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:09.609
clive.martin: So, so, so that's the first thing that most clients talk to me about. And by the way, this is not a Saltous recommendation, this is just a Clyde Martin thing, you should have a look at it.

349
00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:12.150
George Williams: Blade Martin.

350
00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:15.040
George Williams: You should have started your own business up, Clive.

351
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.200
clive.martin: Well, plenty should say that, no, no, I'm joking. But, …

352
00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:25.170
clive.martin: the reason why I like it

353
00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:30.589
clive.martin: as… to suggest, have a look. You can't get…

354
00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:38.149
clive.martin: you can't buy more than the maximum amount under the FSA in one account, so if the maximum's $85,000,

355
00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:45.769
clive.martin: You can put no more than $85,000 in that account if you're doing a 1-year fixed bond, or a 3-year fixed bond, or whatever.

356
00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:50.800
clive.martin: So, in other words, you can't… the money can't be lost under the FSA compensation scheme.

357
00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:52.989
clive.martin: Does that make sense?

358
00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:55.470
George Williams: Right, yeah. Is it 85,000 now?

359
00:31:55.470 --> 00:32:03.309
clive.martin: It is £85,000. Yeah, sorry, you're looking at me, and I was thinking, yes. So, so the fixed rate… Yes. So, so….

360
00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:06.660
George Williams: They all say they're FCS protected, so….

361
00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:08.210
clive.martin: So, so…

362
00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:13.460
clive.martin: Some of the banks, you may not, sort of, have a, sort of, penchance for, like, …

363
00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:17.889
clive.martin: Alryan Bank, you can guess where that's probably coming from. But…

364
00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:22.560
clive.martin: But they all have to apply to the FCA scenario.

365
00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:24.910
clive.martin: So,

366
00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:28.809
George Williams: It's 85,000, it says here, yeah, max 85.

367
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.639
clive.martin: So, all of them… They can't get on, so…

368
00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:39.570
clive.martin: From that point of view, if they go bust, Yes, Greg. So… …

369
00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:47.809
clive.martin: So, it means when you've got your millions, George, sort of floating around your cash bank, you'll have to give a lot of $85,000s. That's the only problem.

370
00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:56.020
George Williams: Yeah, that is very true, isn't it? You'd have to invest in quite a lot.

371
00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:58.890
clive.martin: But, but, even on the easy access.

372
00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:04.599
clive.martin: The top easy access on that is 4.26 with a company called Shawbrook.

373
00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:12.980
George Williams: Right. … So, all I'm saying is, I mean, some of these rates are coming down, but… Yeah.

374
00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:18.560
clive.martin: These are the most attractive in the market, because they're just trying to get the money in,

375
00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:31.730
George Williams: They've got a loan book and they want to fill it up. Yeah. No, no, no, absolutely. So, I mean, I think… I think last year, my portfolio in a year, when I looked at it this morning, I think in a year was around 7.6%.

376
00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:34.930
clive.martin: Your portfolio with us?

377
00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:35.610
George Williams: Yeah.

378
00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:44.479
clive.martin: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's about… sounds about right. That sounds about right. Yeah. And… and obviously, if you go at 7%, that compounds at, that doubles over 10 years.

379
00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:48.940
George Williams: Yeah, I mean, even… I mean, I think over something like…

380
00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:56.619
George Williams: I think I looked at 3-year one, was the other one, and that was… I was quite gobsmacked by that, it was 21%.

381
00:33:57.090 --> 00:33:57.630
clive.martin: Yeah.

382
00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:00.950
George Williams: Over 3 years, which, you know, in….

383
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:03.540
clive.martin: Which includes one of the worst years ever.

384
00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:06.999
George Williams: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, it's like, yeah.

385
00:34:07.150 --> 00:34:13.870
George Williams: So, I think since… since COVID, near enough, we've really, sort of, come out of the… Thank you.

386
00:34:13.870 --> 00:34:19.079
clive.martin: COVID is… from COVID to now, it's been our best five years ever.

387
00:34:19.239 --> 00:34:23.379
George Williams: Yeah. Yeah, I haven't looked… I didn't look at 5 years, but I looked at 3.

388
00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:29.320
clive.martin: Well, if you remember COVID 2000 and 2000, it went down 36% in 6 weeks.

389
00:34:29.469 --> 00:34:31.379
George Williams: I know. I know!

390
00:34:31.389 --> 00:34:41.859
George Williams: Look at it, then. I knew what it was going to be like, so I don't… I don't like inflicting pain on myself. You know, I'm one of these people that goes, can I do anything about that?

391
00:34:41.859 --> 00:34:55.879
George Williams: No, I can't. Well, I could have done. I could have said, sell everything up now. I don't want to lose any more money. But at the end of the day, you will… it will go… it goes back. When it goes down, it always comes back. I mean, I've got a very simple philosophy about these things, you know, you can't…

392
00:34:55.879 --> 00:35:00.879
George Williams: You can't do anything about it, so you just get on with your life, and it is what it is.

393
00:35:01.110 --> 00:35:05.370
clive.martin: But I remember those meetings so well, because …

394
00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:12.010
clive.martin: you have to be quite disciplined in your training, so when things go down a lot.

395
00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:26.719
clive.martin: You have to rebalance back to your original, because if you had a 60% in bonds and… sorry, 60% in equities, 40% in bonds, and then your 60% in equity suddenly becomes 35%, and your bonds becomes… you have to… you have to sell your bonds and buy more equity.

396
00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:30.859
clive.martin: And that… for the youngsters, I could see it almost like they were crying, they were like.

397
00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:40.199
clive.martin: you're just buying into it, you know, you're gonna cut your hands off, this is gonna be a disaster. Anyway, down 36, ended up up 20.

398
00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:41.170
George Williams: Yeah.

399
00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:42.870
clive.martin: Fastest turnaround ever.

400
00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:44.189
clive.martin: And they were like.

401
00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:50.850
clive.martin: Well, why did we do that? I said, because in stressful times, you have to have a process, and you have to stick to it.

402
00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:51.450
George Williams: Yeah.

403
00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:52.760
George Williams: No, I agree.

404
00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:55.510
clive.martin: So, you know…

405
00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:56.440
George Williams: Well, you know….

406
00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:59.999
clive.martin: The vaccine helped, shall we say?

407
00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:06.030
clive.martin: And who… who knows, who knows that the great Oxford University saved our bacon?

408
00:36:06.490 --> 00:36:12.769
clive.martin: So, both for the country and for the investment community, because that, that, …

409
00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:18.050
clive.martin: But anyway, we slightly digress. So, …

410
00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:24.899
clive.martin: In your own words, what would you like to talk about today? And, … Right.

411
00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:47.860
George Williams: Okay, very… I mean, overall, as you know, I'm very happy with what you do, and what the company does, and I've got, you know, if I ever speak to anybody, I always talk to them about Salters and what they've done for me, and whatever. So I, you know, I follow it, and whatever. So there's a few things that I've got. Let me update you with Gareth. So, Gareth…

412
00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:52.940
George Williams: a year ago, okay. …

413
00:36:53.470 --> 00:37:12.820
George Williams: he… he fell out with a new director that had come in. So he was just one below the board, this new board member, director, had come from, quite a harsh PR company. He worked for… Gareth worked for Weber Shandwick, who are literally one or two in the world PR companies.

414
00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:18.020
George Williams: And they brought in this other guy from… I can't remember the name of the company now, but it's their….

415
00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:20.949
clive.martin: Other, number one, number two in the world.

416
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:31.220
George Williams: But they were always known as a very hard, harsh company. The directors, you know, if you don't perform, you're out, bang. Anyway, Weber got hold of him, he became Gareth's boss.

417
00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:42.000
George Williams: And Gareth gets on with everybody, but this guy took an instant dis… dislike, or Gareth took an instant dislike to him about the way he was treated.

418
00:37:42.250 --> 00:38:00.229
George Williams: or way he was treating him. Right, you're not going to live in Tahoe anymore, you're going to move back to San Francisco, da-da-da-da-da. And he said, no need to do that, that's why I was allowed to move here, etc. Anyway, they were making redundancies, and Gareth knew his name was at the top of the list.

419
00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:02.479
George Williams: And, as Atoms last.

420
00:38:03.250 --> 00:38:14.149
George Williams: I think it was about last May time, he was told. So, he was given quite a time for them, he was given about 2 months, 3 months to actually

421
00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:22.060
George Williams: … you know, notice period, which he did, and he set up his own company called Human First.

422
00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:39.689
George Williams: And it basically was just a PR company, and he had a lot of clients that wanted to work with him from previous clients that he'd dealt with. IBM, Digital, you know, there were large companies, and he sold… he didn't have to sell his services, they said, would you do this project for us, would you do that?

423
00:38:39.690 --> 00:38:45.639
George Williams: And he was making a lot of money out of it. However, he… he didn't like

424
00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:51.900
George Williams: the insecurity of running his own company. He's not that type of person.

425
00:38:52.250 --> 00:39:08.070
George Williams: And he's always wanted to try and get out of the, the agency side, because, you know, he was agency side, and that's a completely different philosophy and work pattern of when you're actually working within a company.

426
00:39:08.330 --> 00:39:16.430
George Williams: So, anyway, one of the people, that he met worked for a company called Syngenta. I don't know whether you've heard of Syngenta.

427
00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:17.680
clive.martin: Yes, I'll do nursing.

428
00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:22.649
George Williams: You know, a multi-billionaire, a billion comfort, billion pound company.

429
00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:30.859
George Williams: Anyway, one of the guys contacted me and said, I've been chatting to one of my colleagues in IBM, and we have this position.

430
00:39:31.050 --> 00:39:39.499
George Williams: open for, PR… A director, for comms, et cetera, da-da-da.

431
00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:46.989
George Williams: And I would like to interview for it. So he went for the interview, he was interviewed by 2 or 3 people.

432
00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:51.699
George Williams: Got down to the shortlist of two, and unfortunately he didn't get the job.

433
00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:58.949
George Williams: Because, the guy who did get the job was a BBC, would you believe, journalist.

434
00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:08.990
George Williams: who had all these contacts in the agricultural world. That was his job. Gareth didn't have that, because he's just come from a pure IT background.

435
00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:10.020
clive.martin: Yeah, sure.

436
00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:22.629
George Williams: So… but the guy, his… one of the directors of Xinjiang, to turn around and said, Gareth, I really do like you, I like what you're portraying, I like what you're doing, da-da-da-da-da. He said, so…

437
00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:25.229
George Williams: Bear with me, we're gonna give you a contract.

438
00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:28.060
George Williams: For 6 months, on stupid money.

439
00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:35.819
George Williams: he said, will you sign up for 6 months? So, this was in… by the time this was, in September time?

440
00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:39.540
George Williams: No, later than that. It must have been about October time.

441
00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:45.820
George Williams: He said, we'll give you a contract, but that's it. You have to get rid of all your other clients, we just want you for 6 months.

442
00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:52.689
George Williams: And it was ridiculous money that he was offering. So Gareth said, yeah, but why? He said, because…

443
00:40:52.740 --> 00:41:12.510
George Williams: I've got a… I need to find a role for you. And Gareth went, oh, alright, fair enough. So Gareth was very happy, he was getting paid oodles of money, and he really loved it. This… it gave him a new breath of life, because he was dealing with something he didn't know, agriculture. Who knows about agriculture when you're working in IT?

444
00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:20.590
George Williams: But he… he'd learned about it, fantastically, and in February, the guy said, look, we…

445
00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:38.459
George Williams: we're pretty certain we've got a job. In March, they said, we have got a job, but you need to now come over to Basel in Switzerland, where one of their base and their main directors are. Go over there and be interviewed. So he went over there, and he said, but we need you over here for two weeks.

446
00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:55.029
George Williams: He went, oh, all right then. So, we went out there in the in-between weekend, and had a lovely weekend in Basel with him. But he was interviewed, got on with all the guys, and they finally, I think it was in about May, said, right, we'll offer you a job.

447
00:41:55.220 --> 00:42:02.219
George Williams: Starting the 1st of August. That's slipped back to the 1st of September because of the problems of moving back.

448
00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:06.570
George Williams: And they've basically said, you're on this salary.

449
00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:10.540
George Williams: Which I've, like, fainted on. And they said.

450
00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:11.919
clive.martin: Where, and where's he based?

451
00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:23.119
George Williams: he's… well, that's it. He's moving back to the UK. He's gonna be based, actually, in, Oxford. Well, not Oxford, it's in, Goring. I don't know whether you know Goring?

452
00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:25.040
clive.martin: I do not go against you. Yeah.

453
00:42:25.090 --> 00:42:30.410
George Williams: So he's about 5 minutes out of Goring, where he's renting a place.

454
00:42:30.610 --> 00:42:31.250
clive.martin: Right.

455
00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:46.000
George Williams: We have hired a van tomorrow, and I'm taking, literally, a massive long-wheelbase van with all his stuff that he left here 16 years ago, and other stuff we've bought. I bought him a car, I've had to lend him…

456
00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:51.989
George Williams: Shed loads of money, because he's still trying to get his money out of the U.S. easily, and whatever.

457
00:42:52.230 --> 00:43:08.470
George Williams: So, and that's another part I need to talk to you about. Anyway, this is a background. So, I'm delivering it all to a house that we finally rented accommodation in… in Goring, that he's moving into. It's a beautiful house, a 5-bedroom house.

458
00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:15.740
George Williams: near enough right on the Thames. He's doing that, and he's moving, …

459
00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:33.570
George Williams: So, we're moving everything tomorrow, going up there, it'll be tomorrow and Saturday to build stuff and do stuff and get, you know… you know what it's like, just… because they've got nothing. Their container is coming over with everything they own, and they… when I say they didn't own a lot, they lived in furnished accommodation.

460
00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:34.220
clive.martin: Yeah.

461
00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:44.810
George Williams: Lake Tahoe. Yeah. So, he hasn't got loads of beds, so we've been having to buy beds and stuff like that from everywhere. Anyway, …

462
00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:51.830
George Williams: They're moving into this place for a year while they look for a place up there, because that's where they want to live. One of their head offices is in Reading.

463
00:43:52.780 --> 00:44:09.000
George Williams: another one in Bracknell, and he's got people up in Manchester. He flew over to China last week, because he's got a team over there, he's got a team in New York, he's got a team in San Francisco. Basically, what he's doing, he's heading up the AI

464
00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:17.770
George Williams: for Syngenta in their comms. So it's all around AI comms, for…

465
00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:30.399
George Williams: the process of what they're doing. I mean, it's amazing what he said, because he only knows so much about it, I know even less, but it's a matter of what fertilizer do you put in this ground.

466
00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:36.329
George Williams: To give these results with this particular crop, or whatever.

467
00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:36.840
clive.martin: Yep.

468
00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:48.010
George Williams: compared to the forecasts, you know, they're making. And AI is being able to create these chemicals and fertilizers and whatever to do this.

469
00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:57.330
George Williams: Anyway, but I didn't know until recently, as he said, that it's a… it's now a Chinese-owned company. I didn't know that, but it's now Chinese-owned. Well.

470
00:44:57.380 --> 00:45:08.849
George Williams: everyone seems… every company now seems to be owned by the Chinese, like, you know, I found out Volkswagen are owned by the Chinese as well, and you just… they're all owned by the Chinese, aren't they?

471
00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:11.750
clive.martin: Well, I mean, the, the other…

472
00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:31.789
clive.martin: going back to the whole commodity thing, the big thing is, is having, food and agriculture, and Syngenta is one of the biggest suppliers of fertilization of crop, so you're… the whole world is trying to think about how you get crop fertilization cheaper, quicker, more efficient, and productivity up.

473
00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:37.820
clive.martin: So, it's leading that challenge, and of course, the Chinese, with the most amount of people in the world.

474
00:45:37.950 --> 00:45:43.239
clive.martin: They are the ones that are likely to be starved or not correctly if they don't control it, so…

475
00:45:43.410 --> 00:45:46.290
clive.martin: It's probably that's… it's another big battle.

476
00:45:46.590 --> 00:45:52.589
George Williams: Yeah. So anyway, Gareth's got this role, he starts actually on the 1st of September, because he moves back

477
00:45:52.590 --> 00:46:07.770
George Williams: on Monday, so he's flying in with a whole family and about 15 suitcases, apparently. Because they have to live for the next 2 months until this container comes over with whatever stuff they've got left, and anyway…

478
00:46:07.850 --> 00:46:15.739
George Williams: So, he plans to be there, which is great. It'll be lovely for us, because we'll be able to see him on a more regular basis.

479
00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:26.569
George Williams: So, so that's that, basically. He, he is, he is very well paid, let's put it that way. He's gonna be strapped for cash.

480
00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:35.730
George Williams: Currently, because… He's put one of the children into Mulfsford. Have you heard of Mulford Boys School?

481
00:46:36.070 --> 00:46:39.610
clive.martin: I happen to have that. It's just out….

482
00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:42.710
George Williams: It's just outside Goring, Molford. Okay.

483
00:46:43.970 --> 00:46:46.839
George Williams: And the other one is a, …

484
00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:55.710
George Williams: the next one up, because that's only a prep school, for Isla, their eldest, and they're going to somewhere called Ship Lake.

485
00:46:57.110 --> 00:47:17.110
George Williams: Good lake, yeah. Yeah, so that's where… they will both go there in the end, and as will the third one as well. So it's private school as well, so he was a little bit… when we found out, well, because that's the other thing we've been doing. My feet haven't touched the ground in the last four months. We've been going up there on a regular basis with either him or his wife.

486
00:47:17.110 --> 00:47:26.400
George Williams: Looking at all these hundreds of schools around that area, and then, you know, the following day, looking at loads of properties, and we've been doing that literally every

487
00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:42.339
George Williams: day for I don't know how long, but it's finally all come, and I've said, once he's back on Monday, we're collecting him from the airport without 3 cars. I said, that's it! I'm cutting him off for 3 months. There's none of this. Dad, can you come and help me do this? Dad, can you come and help me do that?

488
00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:43.820
George Williams: So, yeah.

489
00:47:44.560 --> 00:48:00.200
George Williams: I've loved it, actually, I really have. It's been… been great. Back in the negotiating stakes, as well, with people like car dealers. No, no, you're not gonna sell me. No, I know it's the end of your month. No, yeah. So, yeah, he's done that. Now.

490
00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:04.570
George Williams: The one thing why he wanted to introduce you to it is he has got…

491
00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:08.260
George Williams: a financial advisor over in the States at the moment.

492
00:48:08.610 --> 00:48:09.850
clive.martin: Housing. Yeah.

493
00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:15.839
George Williams: Now, this fire… I don't know how much money he's got there, I think quite a lot of money, because it's… they've been in rental.

494
00:48:17.050 --> 00:48:19.660
George Williams: So he's got quite a lot of money saved up.

495
00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:28.580
George Williams: Over there. Which obviously he wants to put into a house here as well, or some of it, but he's got money invested.

496
00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:43.270
George Williams: But he also is keen to have, you know, someone to let him know what to do with his money, and to reinvest it. The guy over there is saying, oh, I can do it all for you, I can do it all from here, and we'll keep the money invested here.

497
00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:53.100
George Williams: But Gareth is now going, actually, you know what? I don't want it invested in America anymore. I want to try and get it out of there and bring it back here.

498
00:48:53.530 --> 00:49:05.920
George Williams: So, hence why he wants to start a conversation with you yourself, and I don't know what it's got it in, I haven't gone into it, Clyde, and I thought it was best if, when he's around, to set up a meeting with yourself.

499
00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:14.049
clive.martin: No, no, look, that's great. I mean, just to be, black and white, obviously there is, …

500
00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:18.649
clive.martin: difficulty. I can't advise on any of his stuff in the US.

501
00:49:18.930 --> 00:49:23.680
clive.martin: No, no, no, no. He would have to make a decision to say.

502
00:49:23.810 --> 00:49:31.780
clive.martin: And obviously take tax advice from the US, that if he sold any of his stuff, what tax he'd pay, and all that type of stuff.

503
00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:35.210
clive.martin: Yeah. So, once the money is in the UK.

504
00:49:35.210 --> 00:49:36.460
George Williams: You can do something.

505
00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:44.429
clive.martin: then basically, I can just go through the whole, whole process in regards to what you can and can't do. But I think, I think, …

506
00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:48.280
clive.martin: It's a very, very different… game.

507
00:49:48.520 --> 00:50:04.909
clive.martin: financial planning in the US versus financial planning in the UK. So there's… there's quite a lot of different rules and regulations that he probably either doesn't… doesn't know or thinks will be a bit strange and all that type of stuff. Yeah. So, and…

508
00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:11.249
clive.martin: So, no, I'm… great, lovely to have a chat with him, and no problems at all. …

509
00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:29.929
clive.martin: But I… I will… I will walk him through slowly, you know, all the UK stuff, because, there will be lots of stuff he can basically do, and, lots of stuff. But… but clearly, you know, he's got to get his feet under the table, he's got to get his house sorted out, he's got to get his….

510
00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:44.529
George Williams: 100%. I've started this conversation off early, because, you know, one of the things he said, Dad, I need over the next year, is to get my money out from you so that I can invest it as a deposit in a house.

511
00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:55.090
George Williams: So that's one of the things he wants to do. So he's got his pension invested out there as well, which he wants to get out, if possible, to over here. He doesn't want his pension over there anymore.

512
00:50:55.170 --> 00:50:57.490
George Williams: So, it's those type of things that he.

513
00:50:57.490 --> 00:51:00.129
clive.martin: Yeah, no, no, look, there's, there's, I mean…

514
00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:04.830
clive.martin: I mean, I'll do whatever I can to help and… Yeah, yeah.

515
00:51:04.830 --> 00:51:05.210
George Williams: Oh, yeah.

516
00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:11.769
clive.martin: production and, and so forth. Just, just going back to the, … Because I looked, …

517
00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:26.079
clive.martin: Do you have a detailed amount that you… that… that… okay, so, and I thought you would have, because I'm glad you have, because I wasn't absolutely 100% certain,

518
00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:34.020
clive.martin: So, how much do you think was invested in him, for him, as it were, and when, and when, when, when did you basically

519
00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:37.610
clive.martin: Oh, okay. You did it, as it were.

520
00:51:38.010 --> 00:51:52.780
George Williams: Hang on a minute, Clive, because I think I sent you, I think, I don't know, half the time. Where am I? Sorry, I'm just going through some emails for finance, EF High, Soltus, Lorica.

521
00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:58.239
George Williams: Here we go, the solstice, let's have a good… oh, it might have been put under carrot investment.

522
00:51:59.150 --> 00:52:04.719
George Williams: No, that was 20 solters here. I have got… I have got more notes on it somewhere, so hang on.

523
00:52:04.850 --> 00:52:09.980
George Williams: Yeah, here we are, Cara's around.

524
00:52:10.110 --> 00:52:14.300
George Williams: So, he invested $80,000….

525
00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:15.120
clive.martin: Yep.

526
00:52:15.270 --> 00:52:22.399
George Williams: in March 2018, And I think that was split between myself and Alison's account.

527
00:52:22.590 --> 00:52:23.300
clive.martin: Okay.

528
00:52:23.450 --> 00:52:27.479
George Williams: And then he invested a further $19,000.

529
00:52:27.650 --> 00:52:30.749
George Williams: on the 8th of April, 2021.

530
00:52:33.410 --> 00:52:38.940
clive.martin: Okay, so we've got $80,000 for 7 years, and we've got $19,000 for 4 years.

531
00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:57.340
George Williams: Yeah, basically, I mean, it's not… as Gareth said to me, Dad, it's not going to be exact, he said, but as long as I've got a ballpark… a ballpark figure of how much that type of is worth now, he said then, you know, when we start looking, he's got to start financially planning, basically.

532
00:52:57.340 --> 00:53:01.449
clive.martin: He's got to understand, he's got to work out how much you can pay for, and all that sort of stuff, yeah.

533
00:53:01.450 --> 00:53:20.419
George Williams: Yeah, so that's what he's got to work out now, how much, you know, what he's got. So if we could get a type of figure for that, and then we can get that. The other thing was, as I said to him, I said it might be worthwhile, and I don't know, you know, the trouble is he's going to draw it out straight away, maybe when he buys a house.

534
00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:37.899
George Williams: is to invest it, you know, if I give it to you, because the reason we couldn't open up an account for him, because he wasn't a resident of the UK, he's now going to be a resident for the UK, so I wonder whether it might be easier to withdraw it now and put it into his own account with you.

535
00:53:38.010 --> 00:53:44.990
George Williams: Or to just to leave it until he works out the pension, and then open up an account with you. I… I don't know.

536
00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:51.059
clive.martin: … I think the issue, …

537
00:53:52.960 --> 00:54:01.079
clive.martin: Can I answer that question once I work out what the number is? Please, please do. And, I mean, look, at the end of the day, …

538
00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:04.630
clive.martin: If… if…

539
00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:22.340
clive.martin: whatever the money is worth, and he thinks that money will be used for a property purchase, if that's what he's basically saying. If his number one goal is to say, right, that money is… I've allocated to property purchase, then there's no point opening an account for him, because basically it's just going to go straight out again.

540
00:54:22.340 --> 00:54:24.460
George Williams: Absolutely, that's what I thought, yeah.

541
00:54:24.460 --> 00:54:34.539
clive.martin: So, but if… if… if he says, yes, I'm going to take that money out and put that, but basically, I'm interested in opening an account, and this is the conversation we're going to have, blah blah blah, then…

542
00:54:34.990 --> 00:54:38.720
clive.martin: That… that's… that's a separate thing, but I think…

543
00:54:39.290 --> 00:54:48.789
clive.martin: I don't want to prejudice the thing, but if… but, you know, his number one goal would be to sort out a house, I think, probably.

544
00:54:48.790 --> 00:54:59.240
George Williams: It will be in the next… you know how long it'll take to get a house, Clive. I mean, by the time they get back here, Christmas, and then putting offers in, and finding something they like, I think it might.

545
00:54:59.240 --> 00:54:59.879
clive.martin: Yeah, no, I agree.

546
00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:00.460
George Williams: Yeah.

547
00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:11.300
clive.martin: No, no, no, no, I agree. So, my gut reaction, is, I mean, obviously, I'm happy to meet him at any time when it's convenient to him, so, …

548
00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:21.239
clive.martin: And then we'll firm that up, and if… if he's basically saying… saying that, then obviously we can sell the stuff at any point, and then you can… you can do it. So, probably… I mean.

549
00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:30.110
clive.martin: flexibility is probably going to be his big key, because, you know, Sobslaw, if he finds a place and he can really move quickly, then he might want to go for it, as it were.

550
00:55:30.110 --> 00:55:46.160
George Williams: Yeah, I know. Okay. Well, let's do that. I mean, again, he needs to get his feet under the table in the UK anyway. He's gonna be, sort of, like, off the scale at the moment for the next, I would say, 2 months, but I just wanted to start getting the….

551
00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:47.640
clive.martin: No, no, look, look… And briefly.

552
00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:48.360
George Williams: Beautiful.

553
00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:52.690
clive.martin: Yeah, no, that's fantastic. What I would basically, …

554
00:55:53.250 --> 00:56:12.399
clive.martin: suggested. I'm very happy to go and see him wherever he is. Right, okay. At a convenient place. And then, basically, I think the first thing is just to start the conversation about what he's looking for in an advisor, what is… what is the whole thing, and then, slowly but surely, then… and then we can talk to him about that, just…

555
00:56:13.220 --> 00:56:19.740
clive.martin: he definitely doesn't want to rush it, but I think it's important just so young… he gets into the whole thought process, because I think…

556
00:56:19.910 --> 00:56:33.379
clive.martin: I don't know any of his benefits that he's going to get here, and all that sort of stuff, and obviously, I don't know what he earns, and therefore, from what you're saying, he's going to be rather shocked in terms of taxation issues over here, maybe.

557
00:56:35.170 --> 00:56:38.579
George Williams: It's in excess of 300.

558
00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:41.979
clive.martin: Right, okay. So, so, you know…

559
00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:50.359
clive.martin: he's paying 47 cents from over 125, that might be a bit of a… he might be, sort of, need to sit down and have a drink first.

560
00:56:51.530 --> 00:57:06.440
George Williams: I know, I think he's gonna get a shock with how much tax he's gonna have to pay on all that, and it's not quite the same as in the US. I've already said that to him, so… I think he realizes he's not… But on the other hand, there are lots of things he can do.

561
00:57:06.510 --> 00:57:12.730
clive.martin: So, you know, there's not… it's not the end of the world. I mean, it's a nice problem to have, rather than a… well, a nasty problem.

562
00:57:12.730 --> 00:57:17.979
George Williams: Well, it's a nice problem that you… you can help him solve. That's the way I… I…

563
00:57:17.980 --> 00:57:33.410
George Williams: put it to you, put it to him, because I didn't, you know, when… when I first met you, God, all those years ago now, when I said, right, HP, I'm going, and yeah, I've got 5 pensions here, there, everywhere. It was, you know, it was…

564
00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:42.110
George Williams: it was brilliant, and that's what I say to everybody at the moment, it's just, you know, the only problem is Labour Company now are bloody…

565
00:57:42.380 --> 00:57:59.359
George Williams: you know, I can't leave all the money to the kids now, because they're going to claim 40% of it, so it's… it won't affect me and Al, but it will mean that they… they claim their fair share of it now, but I think that might well change if the… if another party gets back in, but we'll wait and see.

566
00:58:00.090 --> 00:58:04.550
clive.martin: We'll come back to… we'll come back to that question. …

567
00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:16.280
clive.martin: Okay, so, just to recap on that then, I'll, I'll, I'll work some numbers out in regards to that. Happy to meet him whenever, whenever he's around, and we can, we can, … Yeah.

568
00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:24.169
clive.martin: we can do that, and thank you very much for the referral, that's very kind of you. So, just, just going back to,

569
00:58:25.820 --> 00:58:32.300
clive.martin: To you, and … Charming wife. What's… she's still working.

570
00:58:33.550 --> 00:58:35.750
George Williams: So, I'm just saying goodbye to my grandchildren.

571
00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:36.880
clive.martin: Oh, hello?

572
00:58:40.770 --> 00:58:43.499
clive.martin: Have you tell him he's playing the wrong sport?

573
00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:44.580
George Williams: Yeah, I know.

574
00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:48.730
George Williams: Yeah.

575
00:58:48.730 --> 00:58:52.210
clive.martin: I get in trouble for saying things like that, but I can say that to you.

576
00:58:52.210 --> 00:58:54.962
George Williams: But I do.

577
00:58:56.370 --> 00:59:01.449
George Williams: Yeah, sorry. With regard to me, yeah?

578
00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:05.729
clive.martin: So, … Allison, still working.

579
00:59:06.850 --> 00:59:11.379
George Williams: Less and less and less, Clyde, but she still works bank.

580
00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:14.589
George Williams: You know, like, she hasn't worked for the last 2 months.

581
00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:19.380
George Williams: I think she's got a couple of shifts booked next month.

582
00:59:19.630 --> 00:59:27.280
George Williams: But she is still working. I tried to find out her pension pot the other day.

583
00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:31.349
clive.martin: Yep. And TPT, who it's with, have you heard of TPT?

584
00:59:32.250 --> 00:59:36.430
clive.martin: Can't they have TPT? They are… what's that stand for?

585
00:59:36.430 --> 00:59:37.220
George Williams: I don't know.

586
00:59:37.220 --> 00:59:39.839
clive.martin: But anyway, their systems are being….

587
00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:56.910
George Williams: being transferred for the last 3 months, it's just been a nightmare. So many complaints about it. Anyway, anyway, it's done, and they finally did it, and I looked through, and she's got a healthy pot in there now of, like, I'm sure it's something like about 80 or 90,000 she's got in.

588
00:59:57.910 --> 01:00:03.600
George Williams: So, I mean, we've always said, because she gets such good returns from her working and.

589
01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:04.530
clive.martin: No, no, no, no.

590
01:00:04.530 --> 01:00:05.280
George Williams: contribution.

591
01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:06.420
clive.martin: Absolutely.

592
01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:12.239
George Williams: But, I mean, it's getting to the stage now where she's saying… I mean, she's 70 this year.

593
01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:15.980
clive.martin: Well, I mean, I mean, I… I….

594
01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:17.180
George Williams: Yeah.

595
01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:24.690
clive.martin: I admire her, but she obviously still enjoys doing what she's doing, so, you know, if she still enjoys it, then who am I to say you don't know what you're doing?

596
01:00:24.830 --> 01:00:27.830
George Williams: 100%, and that's what I say, you know.

597
01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:34.279
George Williams: need to do it. You don't need to go to work. We're not, we're not, you know, need the money.

598
01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:35.290
clive.martin: Rap for cash.

599
01:00:35.710 --> 01:00:53.649
George Williams: Yeah, I said, we don't need the money. I said, at the moment, I said I want to try and spend as much money as I can, and I bloody, you know, Labour government bloody didn't get hold of it, but, you know, that… I think we've always said about financial planning for the long term.

600
01:00:54.010 --> 01:00:58.059
George Williams: And that's now starting to come to fruition, where, well.

601
01:00:58.190 --> 01:01:09.979
George Williams: do I start spending a lot more of this money, or what can I do? I mean, the big problem is, I mean, we've talked about private schools. He's sending his two, three, to private school.

602
01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:20.039
George Williams: The big problem I have with that, of doing it, then my daughter can't afford to send her children to private school. I can't pay for those two.

603
01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:36.839
George Williams: And then not for the others. So, I'm in a bit of a catch-22 situation. I can't afford to pay 5 of them. Thank you very much. I'm not that wealthy. Well, I would, I could, but the trouble is, I wouldn't be left with a lot.

604
01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:37.540
clive.martin: …

605
01:01:37.710 --> 01:01:53.579
clive.martin: Okay, can I… can I… before I answer that question, because I think that's quite a specific one, I think I've got… I've got a thing that I think you need to chew over in your head. Okay. I'm doing quite a lot this time, but let… so do you think Alison will… this is going to be her last year?

606
01:01:54.890 --> 01:02:01.160
George Williams: I… I… she said… I think it will definitely be… I'll tell you why, she has to go through, …

607
01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:18.459
George Williams: re-registration, which means revalidation, it's called, that's the word I was looking for. Revalidation, which means that she's had to have done all these courses during the year, do this, do that. Now, she renewed it last year, I think it was.

608
01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:32.639
George Williams: And it lasts for 2 years. So, at some point this year, so next year, she will retire, definitely, and she will come off the bank. Because once… once you haven't been revalidated, she can't go back to work.

609
01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:36.750
clive.martin: Yeah, no, sure. Well, not that… if you're gonna retire.

610
01:02:36.910 --> 01:02:39.930
clive.martin: and stop work. You should retire by the end of…

611
01:02:40.130 --> 01:02:41.920
clive.martin: The end of the tax year.

612
01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:43.590
George Williams: Okay, alright.

613
01:02:43.590 --> 01:02:46.190
clive.martin: Because it's… because then you go into a new tax year with no income.

614
01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:47.430
George Williams: Yep.

615
01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:58.500
clive.martin: Yeah. That's the perfect thing to do for maximizing the scenario. Not that I'm trying to force her in any shape or form to retire, she wants to go on longer than that, but that's the best time to do it, in the sense of

616
01:02:58.640 --> 01:02:59.700
clive.martin: Simplicity.

617
01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:08.349
clive.martin: And then if she's happy, then we can… we can move the money across from that pension, and then basically that's it. Now, …

618
01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:14.169
clive.martin: So, if I'm jumping ahead now and thinking that's going to happen at some point, let's just.

619
01:03:14.170 --> 01:03:14.780
George Williams: Yep.

620
01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:15.730
clive.martin: Put that in the scenario.

621
01:03:15.730 --> 01:03:16.430
George Williams: Definitely.

622
01:03:16.430 --> 01:03:22.589
clive.martin: … What impact do you think that's going to have in your income requirement?

623
01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:30.040
clive.martin: Basically going forward. So, if you both of you aren't working, what do you think your income need is going to be?

624
01:03:31.170 --> 01:03:38.979
George Williams: She was drawing down, basically, on an average, I would think, over the last year.

625
01:03:39.140 --> 01:03:45.840
George Williams: around… £1500 a month, approximately.

626
01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:46.440
clive.martin: Hang on.

627
01:03:46.690 --> 01:03:47.550
clive.martin: Yep.

628
01:03:49.370 --> 01:03:51.589
clive.martin: And, from your point of view.

629
01:03:52.070 --> 01:03:58.380
clive.martin: the income you're getting at the moment, is that… is that still okay? Is it not enough, or what… Yes.

630
01:03:58.580 --> 01:04:04.590
George Williams: It's just started to going, oh, my bank balance is a bit low, …

631
01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:16.729
George Williams: I'm… I'll top it up from some of my other ones. Oh, we need to go on holiday. Oh, I'll take that out of my invest tech. Because what I've always been trying to do, as you know, Clive, is to clear out all of my other odds.

632
01:04:16.730 --> 01:04:22.890
clive.martin: Have you got one of your famous spreadsheets that you can send me again to give me an update in terms of that?

633
01:04:23.230 --> 01:04:23.920
George Williams: No.

634
01:04:24.100 --> 01:04:25.720
clive.martin: No.

635
01:04:26.690 --> 01:04:34.149
clive.martin: Yeah, I'll send it over to you. What's your cash reserve at the moment, just roughly, as it were?

636
01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:39.379
George Williams: Roughly, rough… oh god, I haven't even got a clue, but I can.

637
01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:45.559
clive.martin: within a click of a button. I'm going to test your great systems, I know they all do.

638
01:04:45.560 --> 01:05:04.939
George Williams: The thing is that it is, … no, no. It is quite a bit down at the moment, only because I've lent Gareth about $23,000 to buy this car. So….

639
01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:07.020
clive.martin: What is that for?

640
01:05:07.690 --> 01:05:18.059
George Williams: Yeah, absolutely. So… that I would say… investments, here we go, sorry. Investments in June, doom-dum-dum…

641
01:05:19.230 --> 01:05:25.390
George Williams: So, GIAs are… like, sand down there, here we go.

642
01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:32.120
George Williams: So, I would say, in total, I've got…

643
01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:40.229
George Williams: Where's that come from? No. Total cash, 143,000.

644
01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:42.270
George Williams: No, that's not right.

645
01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:58.020
George Williams: 31… 9, 40, 40, 70… yeah, it is. It's about 130,000, I would say, Clive.

646
01:05:58.020 --> 01:06:07.389
clive.martin: Okay, fine. So, that's… that's… that's… that's plenty cash reserve, cash, cash reserve, as… as… as I would say, unless you're telling me otherwise.

647
01:06:07.610 --> 01:06:19.749
George Williams: No, no, it's absolutely superb at the moment, because what I… what I tend to do is, like, I took the family away on holiday, you know, spent 20 grand at the beginning of the year. I'm thinking about…

648
01:06:20.130 --> 01:06:24.410
George Williams: my car's 6 years old, and I'm thinking about getting a new car.

649
01:06:24.420 --> 01:06:25.310
clive.martin: ….

650
01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:28.229
George Williams: Not an electric one.

651
01:06:30.250 --> 01:06:37.280
George Williams: So yes, I'm thinking about it, but at the moment, that… those type of things, those extra…

652
01:06:37.900 --> 01:06:45.660
George Williams: if you like, spend, I'm doing. I have noticed that, you know, again, my, …

653
01:06:46.930 --> 01:07:00.440
George Williams: my day-to-day costs, as everything, has just gone up. Yeah. So, yeah, I mean, if you remember, I did take it down during COVID, because we just weren't spending any money at all, and I thought, what's the point of it getting paid it? I don't need it.

654
01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:01.020
clive.martin: Yep.

655
01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:03.110
George Williams: It then went up again.

656
01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:13.789
George Williams: And I'm not sure where I am on my… that was the other question I wanted to ask, where I am on my tax-free amount of pension.

657
01:07:14.650 --> 01:07:21.300
clive.martin: That's a good question. I don't know off the top of my head. I can… I can definitely find that out. Yes.

658
01:07:22.350 --> 01:07:26.790
George Williams: Yeah, I don't know how much… how much more… I mean, we did that… oh my god.

659
01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:35.459
George Williams: 10 years ago, I suppose, when I retired, actually. So we've been… I don't know how much we took out of it, and how much I had at that point, but, but….

660
01:07:35.460 --> 01:07:44.420
clive.martin: Just remember, we just did the personal allowance bit, in regards to that, so I can certainly find out for you, that's no problem.

661
01:07:44.730 --> 01:07:45.680
clive.martin: Okay.

662
01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:51.139
clive.martin: So, so, so… I think maybe what, …

663
01:07:52.080 --> 01:08:04.920
clive.martin: unless you say otherwise, I think it'd be useful to see whether you need any more money income starting from next year, in terms of a tax point of view, if you're going to get some money back from your

664
01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:13.779
clive.martin: son and so forth. But, we can change… we can change the income at any point, as you know. So, you know, if you think you need some more, then that's… that's a…

665
01:08:13.790 --> 01:08:15.860
clive.martin: That's a… that's a separate issue, but….

666
01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:38.010
George Williams: a separate issue. It's not at the moment. My, yeah, my current account is going down slowly, and I'm… I tend not to use it now for, oh, you know what, we'll book that holiday for a couple of grand and go away, and I just use it out of my current account. I don't take it out of my current account, I take it out of my savings accounts, you know, wherever I've got that money, and it's just easy to do that I've got.

667
01:08:38.010 --> 01:08:47.270
clive.martin: No, no, no, I get it, I get it. I mean, look, I think, I think the, the, the challenge… oh, one thing. What would you say the value of the property's worth now?

668
01:08:48.930 --> 01:08:50.730
George Williams: I would say about a million.

669
01:08:50.910 --> 01:08:51.620
clive.martin: Okay.

670
01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:58.420
George Williams: around a million, Clyde, something like that. And that's the other problem, you know, yeah, yeah, it is.

671
01:08:58.420 --> 01:09:05.929
clive.martin: So, so, look, … If we take the inheritance tax scenario.

672
01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:11.679
clive.martin: just where we are today. You…

673
01:09:16.210 --> 01:09:23.579
clive.martin: 2.8 or 2.6? I can't… I can't read my own writing in terms of your… what the total amount you've got with us.

674
01:09:24.359 --> 01:09:27.959
George Williams: … So, if I…

675
01:09:28.129 --> 01:09:38.249
George Williams: My total investments, you're right, well, if we take everything from the investments that I've got, like, everywhere.

676
01:09:38.549 --> 01:09:53.589
George Williams: That's my cash, and also the cash that you have. That's about $2.7 million. The house is worth a million, and that gives me a total worth at the moment, I reckon, of $3.7 million.

677
01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:59.209
clive.martin: Correct, yep, that's roughly. So you knock off $650,000.

678
01:10:01.509 --> 01:10:03.769
clive.martin: Because that's your new rate band.

679
01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:05.120
George Williams: Roy.

680
01:10:05.650 --> 01:10:06.869
clive.martin: You understand what Neil White Bond is?

681
01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:08.270
George Williams: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

682
01:10:08.420 --> 01:10:14.150
clive.martin: Okay, so times that by 40%. So at the moment, you're looking at a 1.2 million pound bill.

683
01:10:14.390 --> 01:10:15.770
George Williams: Yeah, I know.

684
01:10:16.390 --> 01:10:17.690
George Williams: Jesus.

685
01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:22.129
clive.martin: So… Don't, don't panic, Mr Mallon.

686
01:10:22.130 --> 01:10:24.740
George Williams: I'm panicked!

687
01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:29.430
clive.martin: So I think, I think there are… there are…

688
01:10:30.030 --> 01:10:32.710
clive.martin: There are 3 things I'm getting clients to think about.

689
01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:36.869
clive.martin: Well, let's go back and stage.

690
01:10:37.020 --> 01:10:40.859
clive.martin: what is your view about that? Is it A,

691
01:10:40.970 --> 01:10:43.700
clive.martin: I don't give a monkeys that someone else's problems.

692
01:10:44.310 --> 01:10:50.069
clive.martin: B, … I am worried about that, but I'm also worried about my own expenditure.

693
01:10:50.190 --> 01:10:55.749
clive.martin: Or C, no, I want to make sure that the government gets as little money as possible.

694
01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:11.149
George Williams: I think I tend to go on C, really. That's… you know, I don't want the government to get my money, but there again, you know…

695
01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:14.950
George Williams: We haven't got a massive…

696
01:11:15.290 --> 01:11:23.319
George Williams: expenditure wish list, or whatever. That hasn't changed. So, yes, I want to spend more on the money that I've got now.

697
01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:28.589
George Williams: I'd like to get it to my children now, if I could.

698
01:11:28.950 --> 01:11:37.250
George Williams: In some method, to make sure we have enough money. So, the things that I always think, I'm going to get to a stage

699
01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:40.549
George Williams: Maybe, maybe not, I don't know. Let's say…

700
01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:48.049
George Williams: in another 15 years' time, or wherever 20 years' time, where I'm going, well, Mum and Dad, you've got to go into a home.

701
01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:59.960
George Williams: You know, the cost of that is, I've always said, the million pounds in the house will cover that, I would think. I would hope it would, because the average life

702
01:12:00.050 --> 01:12:18.390
George Williams: span of someone going into a home, I know, is… is less than 4 years. It is. So, you know, I've calculated that out and got, well, that… that will cover us for a home for that period. So the money. So that then leaves about, you know, two… two… two…

703
01:12:18.890 --> 01:12:21.880
George Williams: 2.7 million to get rid of, somehow.

704
01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.390
George Williams: Without the taxman getting hold of it.

705
01:12:24.580 --> 01:12:30.789
George Williams: Per se. Now, it might be that I pop my clogs next year, and Alison does as well, or whatever.

706
01:12:30.790 --> 01:12:31.620
clive.martin: … Cool.

707
01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:33.810
George Williams: You don't know, you can't….

708
01:12:33.810 --> 01:12:37.819
clive.martin: you need a crystal ball, and I'm not sure if anyone's got any one of those.

709
01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:56.180
George Williams: But I would like to… if there was a way of being able to say, actually, I could do… you know, you read about these trusts or stuff, and then you're the people that are being caught by them, or whatever, or leaving your house in a deed for someone else, and the children get caught with a tax implication, as we did with Alison's mothers.

710
01:12:56.910 --> 01:13:08.640
George Williams: et cetera, et cetera. Well, I'd like to find… I know that I can give the money to the kids at the moment, and I do, and point of fact, I give more than, I think, seven grand or whatever it is at the moment to them.

711
01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:21.869
George Williams: But my view is they're such small amounts that, you know, no one declares it, and I don't think anyone can find out, really, unless the taxman comes along and says, oh, let's have a look at his account.

712
01:13:21.870 --> 01:13:26.399
clive.martin: Well, my ears are slightly shutting at those comments, but, so….

713
01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:27.330
George Williams: I know.

714
01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:31.289
clive.martin: Let's be black and white, but the, …

715
01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:46.829
clive.martin: a pet is basically you should live 7 years, so you live 7 years in regards to that. And if… if in the event that, on your death, that the HMRC are worried about it, they can go back into your situation, and then they can… they can dig everything up. Yeah. So, …

716
01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:56.619
clive.martin: I will perhaps send you a form that you can look at if you want to record this on a regular basis, because I'll show you.

717
01:13:56.620 --> 01:14:14.179
clive.martin: If you've got income versus expenditure rules, where you've got more income than expenditure, you can gift that money out on a monthly basis, or over the year, and that is automatically outside your estate. But you need to record it, because if someone comes back in and says.

718
01:14:14.210 --> 01:14:15.030
clive.martin: You know.

719
01:14:15.070 --> 01:14:20.389
clive.martin: what the hell was that? Then you need to prove it, otherwise it'll go back into the estate, and you might get, you know.

720
01:14:20.700 --> 01:14:28.520
clive.martin: But also from the point of view, if you don't live the 7 years. So, one should be, right now, more…

721
01:14:28.820 --> 01:14:34.040
clive.martin: Than ever, to be clear, because they'll have the ability to check the accounts.

722
01:14:34.150 --> 01:14:40.780
clive.martin: So, that's one. I think one of the, … There's some simple stuff.

723
01:14:40.980 --> 01:14:43.869
clive.martin: that I think people should consider.

724
01:14:44.100 --> 01:14:57.930
clive.martin: But before, before I do that, what do you think your general expenditure is, then? If you're being conservative and say, well, I want to have a certain amount of income to enjoy, what do you reckon the number is, in terms of your point of view?

725
01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:05.759
George Williams: I don't know, actually, to be honest.

726
01:15:07.150 --> 01:15:12.810
clive.martin: What would you say you're spending now? You said Alison's spending about 1500 quid a month.

727
01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:16.170
clive.martin: And you're spending about, ….

728
01:15:19.340 --> 01:15:20.800
George Williams: Yeah, I mean….

729
01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:23.050
clive.martin: Well, you must be spending roughly about 50, aren't you?

730
01:15:24.810 --> 01:15:25.600
George Williams: Yes.

731
01:15:25.780 --> 01:15:29.640
George Williams: I was gonna say 50. I would think, between us.

732
01:15:29.810 --> 01:15:35.269
George Williams: We've got an annual expenditure of between…

733
01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:50.610
George Williams: Yeah, 60 to 70, I would think, with the other bits and pieces. But then, on top of that, you know, we draw down maybe 10, 15K for holidays or other bits and pieces like that, new, whatever.

734
01:15:50.610 --> 01:15:53.620
clive.martin: No, no, so, so, so, …

735
01:15:54.960 --> 01:16:08.280
clive.martin: I was ver… so, I would… I would think that, basically, you should probably be thinking about $85,000 a year, which is $70,000, what I call day-to-day expenditures, and gives you 15 grand for a float for holidays and stuff like that.

736
01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:08.880
George Williams: Yeah.

737
01:16:08.990 --> 01:16:10.740
clive.martin: Yeah. Does that seem fair?

738
01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:16.979
clive.martin: So then… and then you get into the sort of more brutal camp thought process. Well, how long am I going to live for?

739
01:16:17.370 --> 01:16:19.509
George Williams: Right? I know.

740
01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:35.080
clive.martin: And if you take the normal average, so you might, you might, as one client said to me, I'm way above average, I'm going to live way, way beyond the average. I said, fine, then you should plan on that basis, but as a starting point. So, …

741
01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:41.519
clive.martin: Married men are 86, and married women are 89 at the moment, roughly, according to the statistics.

742
01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:42.530
George Williams: Really?

743
01:16:42.530 --> 01:16:53.949
clive.martin: Yeah, as a… as a… as a number. It's only an average, so, you know, obviously some people, you know, we've got the woman who's living, who's 116 today, so, you know, there's quite a… quite a wide scope.

744
01:16:54.330 --> 01:17:01.660
clive.martin: But clearly, part of that is that data includes COVID, and obviously a lot of people died in COVID.

745
01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:08.909
clive.martin: So, you know, so that has an impact, but… So, if you took

746
01:17:09.100 --> 01:17:16.329
clive.martin: whatever figure we worked on. So if we said 85,000, and then we… and then we multiplied,

747
01:17:17.620 --> 01:17:19.980
clive.martin: You're… 72?

748
01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:20.990
George Williams: Yeah.

749
01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:25.020
clive.martin: Okay, so if we took… if we took, …

750
01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:31.439
clive.martin: Sorry, 85,000. And we took 20 years, that takes you to 92.

751
01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:35.249
clive.martin: So that gives you a bit more on the upside.

752
01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:41.839
clive.martin: … So you need £1.7 million worth of assets.

753
01:17:44.290 --> 01:17:45.220
clive.martin: A big cup.

754
01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:48.010
George Williams: about it.

755
01:17:48.010 --> 01:17:49.190
clive.martin: Over that 20 years.

756
01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:50.210
George Williams: Yeah.

757
01:17:50.890 --> 01:17:54.650
clive.martin: Now… …

758
01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:07.039
clive.martin: This is why you need to have a sort of chew over in your own mind, you think whether this sort of makes sense. So, 85,000, …

759
01:18:07.930 --> 01:18:11.600
clive.martin: … Divided by 2 sixths.

760
01:18:14.830 --> 01:18:19.089
clive.martin: So if you took $85,000 out, that's about 3.2% of your pot.

761
01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:25.780
clive.martin: Right, okay. So, if you're looking at…

762
01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:31.610
clive.martin: So, we work on a figure that, if you're talking about an income, if you look at a 4% figure.

763
01:18:32.250 --> 01:18:43.480
clive.martin: Has been conservative long-term asset returns of assets, and if we're in a balanced portfolio, we're trying to make 5, so there's another better than 1% buffer in regards to that.

764
01:18:43.650 --> 01:18:48.180
clive.martin: So you're below the 4%, so… As a starting point.

765
01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:51.720
clive.martin: That would mean if you took that $85,000 out.

766
01:18:53.090 --> 01:18:56.010
clive.martin: Each year, and we made 4%.

767
01:18:56.520 --> 01:18:59.039
clive.martin: You'd have all that money still there, plus a bit more.

768
01:19:00.830 --> 01:19:02.249
clive.martin: In 20 years' time.

769
01:19:04.620 --> 01:19:16.890
George Williams: Yeah, I think you always said that when we first started this conversation off some 15, 20 years ago, about how much I'd have left when we, you know, if you carried on taking this amount.

770
01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:23.689
George Williams: And even now, I still look at the pension pot, and I go, it's exactly the same as it was, like.

771
01:19:23.830 --> 01:19:29.830
George Williams: 10 years ago, 1.3 million, or 1.2 million. It's exactly the same.

772
01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:31.650
clive.martin: So, so…

773
01:19:32.260 --> 01:19:41.429
clive.martin: What that basically says is there's probably a bit of… there's a bit of, freedom in terms of stuff that even if you… as you know.

774
01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:52.899
clive.martin: you spend more money in the first 10, 10, 15 years, it then flattens out, and then it starts coming down. So the reality is, if you're building a buffer, you're probably not going to be spending that in 5-10 years' time.

775
01:19:53.210 --> 01:19:54.640
George Williams: Yeah, yeah.

776
01:19:54.650 --> 01:20:02.410
clive.martin: … And don't forget, obviously, you review each year anyway, so, but on the basis of that.

777
01:20:03.710 --> 01:20:05.370
clive.martin: And you've already got to… so…

778
01:20:05.530 --> 01:20:11.230
clive.martin: You've still got, in our view, 900,000 above the level you think you probably need.

779
01:20:14.470 --> 01:20:15.200
George Williams: Yeah.

780
01:20:15.970 --> 01:20:16.700
clive.martin: But…

781
01:20:17.820 --> 01:20:21.860
clive.martin: That's just the start… this is what… this is what I mean about… this is just a starting figure.

782
01:20:22.110 --> 01:20:25.520
clive.martin: Now, the question is, is that still there?

783
01:20:25.710 --> 01:20:28.699
clive.martin: Paying $1.2 million.

784
01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:30.329
clive.martin: Of the whole thing.

785
01:20:30.540 --> 01:20:34.819
clive.martin: So if you did nothing, and it carried on growing in another 20 years.

786
01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:40.449
clive.martin: The likelihood is that that bill's likely to go up slightly over time.

787
01:20:40.580 --> 01:20:44.789
clive.martin: Because your other assets will have gone up as well, so, …

788
01:20:45.860 --> 01:20:47.649
clive.martin: The bill's likely to get bigger.

789
01:20:48.390 --> 01:20:50.069
clive.martin: So, I would say to clients.

790
01:20:50.370 --> 01:20:59.730
clive.martin: if you're comfortable with your number being good, and, you know, $85,000 as a starting point, I think is a reasonable go at it.

791
01:20:59.990 --> 01:21:06.299
clive.martin: That's not say you can't change your mind at any point, by the way, you're not locked into the 20 years, you can only take 85 grand back, and that would be silly.

792
01:21:06.420 --> 01:21:12.370
clive.martin: … is… what can I do that actually will make it?

793
01:21:12.610 --> 01:21:16.320
clive.martin: sensible that I don't end up with a huge, great bill.

794
01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:17.870
George Williams: Yes.

795
01:21:17.870 --> 01:21:20.200
clive.martin: Now, there's no silver bullet.

796
01:21:20.950 --> 01:21:26.200
clive.martin: There's a lot of… there's lots of things you can do that all add up.

797
01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:29.220
clive.martin: If that makes sense.

798
01:21:29.220 --> 01:21:31.100
George Williams: Okay, yes, it does, yeah.

799
01:21:31.100 --> 01:21:34.720
clive.martin: Now, remind me, how many grandchildren do you have?

800
01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:36.200
George Williams: Five.

801
01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:37.319
clive.martin: Alright, there you go.

802
01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:40.990
clive.martin: Football, football 5 aside, too.

803
01:21:43.510 --> 01:21:45.930
clive.martin: … Okay.

804
01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:52.100
clive.martin: So, … We've talked about, we've talked about toothing,

805
01:21:52.450 --> 01:21:57.860
clive.martin: You can gift money outside your estate and live 7 years, and you know how you just write the check and boff, there you go.

806
01:21:57.860 --> 01:22:00.949
George Williams: Is that… that's to each grandchildren, or e….

807
01:22:00.950 --> 01:22:10.269
clive.martin: Each child? Any person you like, doesn't have to be a grandchild. You can give your money whoever you want. Whoever you give it to, you've just got to last 7 years.

808
01:22:10.490 --> 01:22:12.070
clive.martin: And then it's outside your state.

809
01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:18.909
George Williams: Right. So, how much are you allowed to give without

810
01:22:19.010 --> 01:22:23.679
George Williams: it being taxed, or… or notifying anyone, or….

811
01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:38.509
clive.martin: There are small amounts that you can… you can do, and I can… I can… but in reality, it's, you know, it's like 3 grand in total a year you can start giving out as a… as a gift with no taxation. But if you want to… if you want to reduce it properly… Yes.

812
01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:41.460
clive.martin: You'll have to think about the 7-year rule at the moment.

813
01:22:41.980 --> 01:22:43.480
George Williams: Right. Okay.

814
01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:49.840
clive.martin: That's… that's… that's… So, I just want to sort of run through a couple of things that you can think about.

815
01:22:49.990 --> 01:22:52.880
clive.martin: … So we've spoken about

816
01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:58.940
clive.martin: writing gifts straight away, income versus expenditure. The third one is actually, buying some life cover.

817
01:23:01.070 --> 01:23:01.870
George Williams: Okay.

818
01:23:01.870 --> 01:23:09.640
clive.martin: Now, so you've probably never thought about this, but a whole-of-life plan, which basically can pay out on the second death.

819
01:23:10.510 --> 01:23:13.770
clive.martin: We'll pay part of the bill,

820
01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:23.639
clive.martin: Or also, is if you do some planning, if you've got another 20 years to go, then you're… if you do some planning, that gives us plenty of time to reduce the estate.

821
01:23:24.700 --> 01:23:25.909
clive.martin: If that makes sense.

822
01:23:25.910 --> 01:23:26.750
George Williams: Yes.

823
01:23:26.750 --> 01:23:28.480
clive.martin: So…

824
01:23:28.730 --> 01:23:34.109
clive.martin: what I would… what I would… the way I work… the way I weigh and work this out…

825
01:23:34.250 --> 01:23:45.090
clive.martin: Is, broadly speaking, between 10 or 20% of what your figure is today is the amount that you should probably insure yourself for if you want to go down to the life cover route.

826
01:23:46.210 --> 01:23:53.799
clive.martin: So that's probably about £200,000, is 200, 250,000 life cover. Now, …

827
01:23:53.930 --> 01:24:02.229
clive.martin: What that means, in simple terms, is that you know that in the event there's a second death, it will be paid out to your beneficiaries.

828
01:24:02.850 --> 01:24:07.379
clive.martin: And those beneficiaries can be your children or their grandchildren, depending on

829
01:24:07.580 --> 01:24:19.239
clive.martin: how you want to do that. But you know that they will have a certain amount of money that they can then either use that money for themselves, or to pay some of the bill if there isn't, you know, it could take a while to pay that bill.

830
01:24:20.890 --> 01:24:27.099
clive.martin: So, so, … And you can stop that at any time if you want to.

831
01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:32.309
clive.martin: So if you've got rid of all your estate and everything's there, you don't need it anymore, you don't have to pay it any longer.

832
01:24:33.060 --> 01:24:41.850
clive.martin: So… but I do think it's something that most people, should think about as part of the package that I think, in terms of planning, it works.

833
01:24:42.430 --> 01:24:43.270
George Williams: Okay.

834
01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:45.060
clive.martin: Now…

835
01:24:45.170 --> 01:25:00.889
clive.martin: The next one, you talked about trust, and you had that sort of skeptical look about, or trust the bloody complicated, they've all gone horribly wrong. So there are, there are, … have you heard or ever thought about a thing called a discretionary trust?

836
01:25:02.330 --> 01:25:19.050
George Williams: No, I'm not… I've not really looked into trusts at all, to be honest. I've just heard some horrible things that's happened with trusts, that's all. Okay. Because the law changes quite rapidly, and all of a sudden, you know, you get caught by this trust or that trust, and saying, well, no, we can't pay that out.

837
01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:38.650
George Williams: Or, in terms of what Alison had with, you know, the interest on the house that her mother and father had left them in trust, okay? We were paying something like 55% tax on the interest that it had gained, which was shedloads of money at the end of the day.

838
01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:53.149
clive.martin: Yeah, property is a completely separate issue, and I… and I, you know, my own… my own view on that, I don't think you can do anything really, I think, proper and sensible, boring financial planning on housing. I think that's a bit tricky, but…

839
01:25:53.310 --> 01:25:54.000
clive.martin: …

840
01:25:54.850 --> 01:26:05.820
clive.martin: The nil rate band, your 325,000 nil rate band, which you can use in the event of death to offset some of the, bill, you could set up a discretionary trust using a nil rate band today.

841
01:26:06.690 --> 01:26:15.779
clive.martin: So you place $325,000 in a discretionary trust. A discretionary trust is what it means, is that you and Alison will be the trustees.

842
01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:19.249
clive.martin: And you are the only people who can decide where that money goes.

843
01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:21.220
George Williams: Right, okay.

844
01:26:21.220 --> 01:26:34.400
clive.martin: Now, the reason why I think that might be more appropriate for you is because you've got a classic family situation, which, only you will be able to have a better judgment on, and you've already said one thing, you said, well, I can't afford to…

845
01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:43.090
clive.martin: help them out on the school fees for that one, and then, because I won't be able to help. So the issue is, you might say, well, at the end of the day, I want to give

846
01:26:43.650 --> 01:26:46.219
clive.martin: A number to each grandchild, or

847
01:26:46.430 --> 01:26:51.590
clive.martin: or family, so that it's equal. What they then do with that money is completely up to them.

848
01:26:52.780 --> 01:26:53.810
George Williams: Right, okay.

849
01:26:53.810 --> 01:26:54.790
clive.martin: Does that make sense?

850
01:26:55.010 --> 01:26:55.590
George Williams: Yeah.

851
01:26:55.890 --> 01:26:57.630
clive.martin: But you decide where it is.

852
01:26:58.160 --> 01:27:03.609
clive.martin: And if… and if one of them said, I want to come… can I… can I have 30 grand from the trust dad to buy a Porsche, you can say no.

853
01:27:05.790 --> 01:27:12.200
clive.martin: If you can say someone like, you know, he's going on a rugby tour to Canada, and you go, how much it is, can I come with you?

854
01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:17.050
clive.martin: one of those. So, …

855
01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:29.230
clive.martin: Now, that $325,000, if it lasts for 7 years, you last for 7 years, so that's… that's sec… that's, … if you did that, then that is completely outside your estate.

856
01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:34.159
George Williams: Okay. So you say 325 times times 40%.

857
01:27:34.710 --> 01:27:39.050
George Williams: Is that making in that trust, is that making money at the same time?

858
01:27:39.950 --> 01:27:44.119
clive.martin: George, I could almost… That was the next question I thought you might ask me.

859
01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:53.770
clive.martin: If you invest in the same portfolio that you've been in for a long period of time, so you can do the same thing, so the trust can grow as well.

860
01:27:54.590 --> 01:28:03.590
clive.martin: So, if… if basically, over the… over a 7-year period, and I'm… I'm using this for simple math, if it doubles and turns into 650,

861
01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:07.630
clive.martin: The trust is then worth $650, and you can… that can all go to…

862
01:28:08.010 --> 01:28:09.880
clive.martin: And that's also outside of your estate.

863
01:28:11.890 --> 01:28:20.810
George Williams: Right, and in terms of drawing it out, you can decide, I can decide, or if it's obviously Alison and I can decide.

864
01:28:21.250 --> 01:28:24.649
George Williams: Where it can go to, and what it could be spent on.

865
01:28:25.710 --> 01:28:28.770
clive.martin: Who it goes to, how much, and what they're doing it.

866
01:28:29.140 --> 01:28:29.880
George Williams: Okay.

867
01:28:30.190 --> 01:28:34.019
George Williams: Well, that makes… that makes sense, yeah. Is there a catch?

868
01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:41.890
clive.martin: Well, there's… look, I've told you, there's no perfect world. Yeah. Let me talk about the sort of things that you need to consider.

869
01:28:42.140 --> 01:28:45.230
clive.martin: … After 10 years.

870
01:28:45.460 --> 01:28:51.290
clive.martin: So the trust is still going after 10 years. The profit from the money that you've invested

871
01:28:51.710 --> 01:28:55.499
clive.martin: So, anything that's grown above the 325 is taxed at 6%.

872
01:28:56.030 --> 01:28:56.890
George Williams: At how much?

873
01:28:56.890 --> 01:28:57.760
clive.martin: 6%.

874
01:28:58.440 --> 01:28:59.380
George Williams: 6.

875
01:28:59.380 --> 01:29:00.010
clive.martin: Fix.

876
01:29:01.130 --> 01:29:01.820
clive.martin: Okay.

877
01:29:03.530 --> 01:29:04.420
George Williams: Okay.

878
01:29:04.420 --> 01:29:08.360
clive.martin: And that money can then be taken out of that trust and paid out, within that.

879
01:29:09.050 --> 01:29:12.540
clive.martin: So it's… compared to 40% to 6%, it's a pretty good deal.

880
01:29:14.020 --> 01:29:16.000
George Williams: Yes, very good deal.

881
01:29:16.190 --> 01:29:20.369
clive.martin: So, but there… but there is… but there is that… there is that taxation issue. Now…

882
01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:26.769
clive.martin: This is where it gets really, really complicated. If after 7 years, you've lived 7 years.

883
01:29:26.990 --> 01:29:30.909
clive.martin: Then you can actually, anyone believes this, set up another one.

884
01:29:31.450 --> 01:29:33.070
clive.martin: And using the white band again.

885
01:29:36.940 --> 01:29:37.610
George Williams: Right.

886
01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:42.730
George Williams: But once that… once that money's in that trust, that's it. You could…

887
01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:49.079
George Williams: You can't take it out and reinvest it with you, because it's in a trust fund for….

888
01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:56.569
clive.martin: You know, so the trust is just a document, and we would carry on looking after the investment of the…

889
01:29:57.120 --> 01:30:00.190
clive.martin: Okay? That money is not legally yours.

890
01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:05.909
George Williams: Oh, I don't like that. No, go on. Yeah, but it's not….

891
01:30:05.950 --> 01:30:07.590
clive.martin: But, thoughts, but, but, but…

892
01:30:07.810 --> 01:30:17.289
clive.martin: So, if, what a lot of people… if, let's say, we did all this lovely little homework, and we said, you need $85,000, by the end of it, it's suddenly, oh, shit, I need a lot more.

893
01:30:17.570 --> 01:30:24.249
clive.martin: … Discretionary trusts can pay the beneficiaries, which could be your children, or your grandchildren.

894
01:30:24.510 --> 01:30:26.790
clive.martin: And they could then pay

895
01:30:26.900 --> 01:30:36.629
clive.martin: If you have to go into a home, for example, and there was… there was more money required, because it then is their money, and if they wanted to pay their… your bill for… they could do that.

896
01:30:37.210 --> 01:30:41.050
clive.martin: … If you wanted to take them all on holiday.

897
01:30:42.040 --> 01:30:48.659
clive.martin: And the trust did quite well, you could pay them the money, and then the trust… the beneficiaries could then pay the whole debt with the trust money.

898
01:30:49.290 --> 01:30:55.559
clive.martin: So you are still paying for it, but it's just been around, and you've capped off that growth of it, and it's carried on growing.

899
01:30:56.070 --> 01:31:03.020
clive.martin: The only issue is, I've got enough money in my mind that I'm… I'm gonna be okay, Governor.

900
01:31:04.270 --> 01:31:09.300
clive.martin: I've still got my $85,000 for 20 years, that's… I've worked out 1.7, so I've still got

901
01:31:09.490 --> 01:31:11.140
clive.martin: I've still got some money left over.

902
01:31:11.740 --> 01:31:20.799
George Williams: So, just one question, Clive. Could we take that, let's say, $150 from Al, 150 from myself, or whatever it is, and shove in there?

903
01:31:22.100 --> 01:31:27.749
clive.martin: Yeah, you could. It doesn't matter where the money comes from, but in reality.

904
01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:32.369
clive.martin: The reason why, the maximum you can do is a nil rate band.

905
01:31:32.370 --> 01:31:32.970
George Williams: Yeah.

906
01:31:33.470 --> 01:31:38.240
clive.martin: If you could afford a nilrate band, it's the 325 where the money comes from, doesn't matter.

907
01:31:38.470 --> 01:31:39.740
George Williams: Okay. Alright.

908
01:31:41.330 --> 01:31:46.850
clive.martin: … And then, obviously, if you keep reviewing each year, depending on how the funds are doing.

909
01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:57.039
clive.martin: You know, so if the funds were growing more on the rest of your stuff within Solstice, i.e. the thing was catching back up again, even though… then you can always, you know.

910
01:31:57.830 --> 01:31:59.679
clive.martin: Gift that a bit more.

911
01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:05.760
clive.martin: So you'll keep reviewing it each year, but you start off with

912
01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:13.680
clive.martin: You buy some life cover, that gives you something like $200,000, $250,000. Then you've got $325,000, so that's $500,000.

913
01:32:15.350 --> 01:32:17.050
clive.martin: Just on those two things.

914
01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:22.010
George Williams: So, on the… going back to the life cover, how much does that cost?

915
01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:28.090
clive.martin: Well, that would depend on, on, two factors. Your age and your health.

916
01:32:28.580 --> 01:32:33.800
clive.martin: And obviously, what we do is simply… I can easily do it, I'm doing it… I'm doing it every day at the moment.

917
01:32:33.910 --> 01:32:42.149
clive.martin: Okay. Get you a quote for a number, and then you can see whether you think, oh, that's far too expensive, or that seems really reasonable, whatever.

918
01:32:42.370 --> 01:32:49.849
clive.martin: But I think… As a combination, you add those, just doing those two things, That's almost halving the bill.

919
01:32:53.610 --> 01:32:54.330
George Williams: Yeah.

920
01:32:54.440 --> 01:32:55.690
George Williams: No, I say that.

921
01:32:55.690 --> 01:33:03.780
clive.martin: So, 3 to 5… You're… you are losing it, but you're… you're still in control of it.

922
01:33:05.020 --> 01:33:06.509
George Williams: You can still spend it.

923
01:33:07.610 --> 01:33:11.410
clive.martin: The trust can still spend it, but obviously it's the beneficiaries who have to spend it.

924
01:33:13.050 --> 01:33:13.630
George Williams: Yeah.

925
01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:19.660
clive.martin: So, it'll be… it's completely up to you who they are.

926
01:33:20.690 --> 01:33:21.320
George Williams: Yeah.

927
01:33:21.980 --> 01:33:23.020
clive.martin: So, that's….

928
01:33:23.020 --> 01:33:25.999
George Williams: Yeah, so my beneficiaries could well be…

929
01:33:27.290 --> 01:33:31.319
George Williams: Yeah, my son, my daughter, and my grandchildren.

930
01:33:32.790 --> 01:33:39.439
clive.martin: Well, I mean, I'm going to say the obvious thing, depending on the age of the children and so forth, but,

931
01:33:39.770 --> 01:33:42.130
clive.martin: By skipping two generations.

932
01:33:43.210 --> 01:33:43.840
George Williams: Yeah?

933
01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:45.670
clive.martin: That's proper financial planning.

934
01:33:46.150 --> 01:33:47.340
clive.martin: Because if…

935
01:33:47.860 --> 01:33:53.350
clive.martin: And again, this is where… this is where it becomes important, and this is where you come important in terms of where you choose it.

936
01:33:53.460 --> 01:33:57.119
clive.martin: If you think… Gareth doesn't need the money.

937
01:33:57.520 --> 01:33:58.160
George Williams: Yeah.

938
01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:02.690
clive.martin: But it's useful for the grandchildren. You might want to give the money to the grandchildren.

939
01:34:03.790 --> 01:34:07.740
clive.martin: If your daughter, however, needs the money for her.

940
01:34:08.020 --> 01:34:10.840
clive.martin: Helping out with the kids, you might want to give it to her.

941
01:34:11.190 --> 01:34:15.909
clive.martin: That's the whole point of a discretionary, and only you will know how that… how that fits.

942
01:34:17.690 --> 01:34:23.890
George Williams: Right, so we can put them in there for it, but do you have to decide when you do this discretionary trust?

943
01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:34.509
George Williams: that they all get the equal amounts, or can it be, again, discretionary about, actually, I want to give them that amount, and her that amount?

944
01:34:35.060 --> 01:34:42.529
George Williams: That's why it's called a discretionary trust. That's what… that's why… sorry, I was just wanting qualification on that, yeah.

945
01:34:42.530 --> 01:34:46.150
clive.martin: And that's why, in your particular case.

946
01:34:46.730 --> 01:34:51.370
clive.martin: Look, you can do a thing called a bear trust, which is simply, I'm…

947
01:34:51.470 --> 01:34:57.690
clive.martin: It's 50 grand for one of my grandchildren, but it… once it's absolutely… it can't change.

948
01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:06.229
clive.martin: I don't think you want that, and should need that. I think you should want to have that full discretionary in regards to that process.

949
01:35:06.430 --> 01:35:07.020
George Williams: Yeah.

950
01:35:07.150 --> 01:35:07.990
George Williams: Yeah.

951
01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:13.250
clive.martin: But you can't get to that point, should I do it, until you're happy with

952
01:35:13.370 --> 01:35:15.710
clive.martin: The first thought process is, well.

953
01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:25.049
clive.martin: if 85 grand… if 85 grand's a starting point, and I multiply that by 20, and I've still got my 1.7 million.

954
01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:29.050
clive.martin: Why do I need this extra bits?

955
01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:30.840
George Williams: Okay.

956
01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:33.099
clive.martin: Now, so, …

957
01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:41.199
clive.martin: And there are other stuff that you can look at, which is… which is, …

958
01:35:42.390 --> 01:35:46.660
clive.martin: More risky in the sense of investment stuff, but you can do business relief.

959
01:35:46.820 --> 01:35:53.639
clive.martin: Up to a million quid a year, which, if you invest in it, and you last two years, it's 100% outside your estate.

960
01:35:55.220 --> 01:35:57.919
clive.martin: But that's more for people who

961
01:35:58.510 --> 01:36:05.859
clive.martin: Perhaps got maybe a bit more, or are slightly older, who've only got a short period of time to live, and that's the only way around getting the money out of the estate.

962
01:36:06.390 --> 01:36:14.629
clive.martin: I think, if you did those two things, and you did some income and expenditure and some potential gifts outright.

963
01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:20.950
clive.martin: … You know, just on those two, two things at $250 and a 3, you've halved the bill.

964
01:36:22.500 --> 01:36:24.310
clive.martin: Almost half of the bill.

965
01:36:24.530 --> 01:36:32.150
clive.martin: Without… without actually… the only costing is basically… is your slightly excess pain for the life cover.

966
01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:37.569
George Williams: So, just… sorry, I'm just a little bit…

967
01:36:37.770 --> 01:36:44.189
George Williams: reiterate for me how the life cover actually works again. So, I pay a premium.

968
01:36:44.370 --> 01:36:58.139
clive.martin: Yeah, you pay a premium, and let's call it 500 quid a month, let's just come up with a number. So it's 6 grand a year, and you live 20 years, that's what you… you'd have paid out 120 grand in terms of, of premiums.

969
01:36:58.440 --> 01:37:02.780
clive.martin: And it will pay out $250,000 in terms of… on death.

970
01:37:03.830 --> 01:37:10.220
George Williams: Right, okay. Okay. So do you do it for a period of time, or is it once it's set up, that's it?

971
01:37:10.220 --> 01:37:22.060
clive.martin: that's what a whole of life is a whole of life until you… the second die… person dies. So you carry on paying that premium for that… for that length of time. So if you both got killed in a car crash the second month.

972
01:37:22.340 --> 01:37:25.719
clive.martin: You'll have paid one premium, and $250,000 would be paid.

973
01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:29.160
George Williams: But if I live for another 20 years.

974
01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:36.029
clive.martin: For 20 years, we've paid out £120,000 in premiums, but you're still getting £250,000 on debt.

975
01:37:37.300 --> 01:37:41.710
clive.martin: So your break-even point, you'd have to live probably 40 years.

976
01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:48.179
George Williams: Okay, I'm with it, I'm with it, with it. Yeah, I… I… I understand.

977
01:37:48.570 --> 01:37:51.830
clive.martin: And the reason why you look at both.

978
01:37:52.190 --> 01:37:54.639
clive.martin: as a combination, why I think it's useful.

979
01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:57.639
clive.martin: It's because you don't know how long you're gonna live for.

980
01:37:58.280 --> 01:37:59.120
George Williams: No.

981
01:37:59.650 --> 01:38:03.100
George Williams: Question, is that done on both of our lives, or is that done on….

982
01:38:03.100 --> 01:38:05.009
clive.martin: No, it's done both of your lives.

983
01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:10.130
George Williams: So what… and when does that… So if, if let's say….

984
01:38:10.130 --> 01:38:12.110
clive.martin: I died first. Yep.

985
01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:14.969
George Williams: Does… does that mature at that point, or…?

986
01:38:14.970 --> 01:38:19.820
clive.martin: No, no, so it only pays out on the second death, so you keep paying the premiums on the second death.

987
01:38:20.550 --> 01:38:31.020
George Williams: So, so… Would the premium then reduce, or not? No, it would still be the same? No. Okay, alright, that just… yeah, fine. No, I understand.

988
01:38:31.190 --> 01:38:31.760
George Williams: Okay.

989
01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:39.650
clive.martin: But… but ultimately, You've got two simple decisions to make that are complicated to agree on.

990
01:38:41.610 --> 01:38:47.859
clive.martin: Is $85,000 is a good starting point for the next 20 years, and you have all that money, …

991
01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:50.729
clive.martin: We know the mass is 1.7 million.

992
01:38:51.550 --> 01:38:56.840
clive.martin: So, if that figure is good in your mind, then you know you're going to have some surplus.

993
01:38:57.810 --> 01:39:12.460
clive.martin: So, all I… all I'm saying is, on that basis, if we just start with this, you've got 900 surplus. If you took 325 out, and you do some life covers on the side, you've still got about 600,000 left.

994
01:39:13.140 --> 01:39:20.110
clive.martin: And you then got 20 years, to… decrease the, the bill.

995
01:39:20.490 --> 01:39:23.129
clive.martin: In simple terms, I mean, you'll spend a bit more money.

996
01:39:24.500 --> 01:39:27.299
clive.martin: Or gifted out, depending on how you want to do it.

997
01:39:29.580 --> 01:39:31.100
George Williams: Right, okay.

998
01:39:31.140 --> 01:39:31.970
clive.martin: Yeah.

999
01:39:31.970 --> 01:39:35.729
George Williams: Fine. So you said 5 points. I think that was 4.

1000
01:39:36.270 --> 01:39:47.570
clive.martin: Okay, so, so, we talked about the business tax relief, the one you can do for 2 years. Yeah. You can go up to a million quid, so that's, that's another option. And then you've got AIM,

1001
01:39:47.700 --> 01:39:49.230
clive.martin: the AIM Index.

1002
01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:56.669
clive.martin: Right. Which is… which is basically smaller, smaller companies, and you invest in that, and after 2 years, you've got a 50% relief.

1003
01:39:57.100 --> 01:40:01.719
clive.martin: So you put 100 grand in, 50 grand is automatic outside your estate after 2 years.

1004
01:40:02.810 --> 01:40:04.010
George Williams: Right, okay.

1005
01:40:05.500 --> 01:40:09.009
clive.martin: And the last thing is, that most people don't do.

1006
01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:14.299
clive.martin: Is basically you can trade down on your house, and then gift some money away.

1007
01:40:16.270 --> 01:40:18.629
clive.martin: So if you're saying your house is worth a million quid.

1008
01:40:18.630 --> 01:40:19.260
George Williams: Yep.

1009
01:40:20.020 --> 01:40:23.040
clive.martin: I said to you, George, will you ever leave your home?

1010
01:40:23.540 --> 01:40:25.169
clive.martin: And most people go, no, I won't.

1011
01:40:25.330 --> 01:40:26.130
George Williams: No.

1012
01:40:26.130 --> 01:40:28.390
clive.martin: I'm really happy where I am, blah blah blah, all that stuff.

1013
01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:35.050
clive.martin: And I say to you, well, is there… is there somewhere, as you get older, … And again…

1014
01:40:35.190 --> 01:40:36.990
clive.martin: Do you want to live on that hill?

1015
01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:42.139
clive.martin: Don't… don't… don't you want a flat.

1016
01:40:42.340 --> 01:40:44.430
clive.martin: A flat place as you get older.

1017
01:40:46.010 --> 01:40:47.059
clive.martin: Question mark.

1018
01:40:47.290 --> 01:40:49.230
George Williams: Yeah, I know, I understand, yeah.

1019
01:40:49.230 --> 01:40:56.569
clive.martin: And then the issue on that is, is that going to release some capital, which will then give you more money to either spend or

1020
01:40:57.220 --> 01:40:59.019
clive.martin: Protect yourself, or gift.

1021
01:41:00.410 --> 01:41:02.870
clive.martin: Because it's the property, it's the most illiquid thing.

1022
01:41:03.180 --> 01:41:03.960
George Williams: Yeah.

1023
01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:05.620
George Williams: No, booked you with that.

1024
01:41:05.910 --> 01:41:11.660
clive.martin: So I've, you know, I've got a client who I saw last week. He's got 11… 11 properties.

1025
01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:14.909
clive.martin: All in Tunbridge Wells.

1026
01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:18.789
clive.martin: worth about $3.4 million. And I said to him.

1027
01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:22.780
clive.martin: iPads sell them. And he said, no. I said, why?

1028
01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:30.050
clive.martin: He said, because I've lived… I live in the town, I've known all the people in there, I don't want to walk down the street and be told that I'm turfing people out.

1029
01:41:31.610 --> 01:41:34.420
clive.martin: So I said, you're happy to have a £2.9 million pound bill.

1030
01:41:34.890 --> 01:41:35.940
clive.martin: Three children.

1031
01:41:39.340 --> 01:41:40.290
clive.martin: Explain.

1032
01:41:41.630 --> 01:41:43.100
George Williams: Wow, yeah.

1033
01:41:43.350 --> 01:41:53.579
clive.martin: So, so, so people, you know… Yeah. And sadly, his wife died about 6 months ago, so he's… he's obviously in a, in a, you know, difficult thing. But…

1034
01:41:54.430 --> 01:41:59.589
clive.martin: So you do have to… Want not to pay the bill.

1035
01:42:00.500 --> 01:42:02.459
George Williams: I know the money.

1036
01:42:02.460 --> 01:42:06.830
clive.martin: And at the moment, A lot of people say they don't want to pay the bill, but the bill

1037
01:42:07.150 --> 01:42:13.330
clive.martin: April to June this year, the increase in, in IHT bill is $1.9 billion.

1038
01:42:13.620 --> 01:42:14.630
clive.martin: In the UK.

1039
01:42:15.020 --> 01:42:26.149
clive.martin: So, clearly, most people don't understand it, don't really want to go through with it, and then put their head in the sand, because they get to a certain age and they go, oh, I don't care.

1040
01:42:27.490 --> 01:42:31.489
clive.martin: And then the children of those people find it difficult to go, oh, bloody hell.

1041
01:42:31.700 --> 01:42:33.070
clive.martin: We need to sort them out.

1042
01:42:34.230 --> 01:42:41.090
clive.martin: So the daughter sent me to this 78-year-old guy last week, saying, can you try and help? Because, you know.

1043
01:42:41.470 --> 01:42:45.200
clive.martin: He doesn't quite know what to do now. So… …

1044
01:42:45.890 --> 01:42:55.699
clive.martin: You've got time, but, if you don't think about these things, and you don't put some plan in action, or are happy

1045
01:42:56.070 --> 01:42:57.490
clive.martin: with doing nothing.

1046
01:42:58.380 --> 01:43:01.479
clive.martin: Then you are always going to be a bill.

1047
01:43:02.110 --> 01:43:08.969
clive.martin: And it's just a question of how big… how big it is. Now, not the sexiest of topics, not the greatest thing.

1048
01:43:08.970 --> 01:43:17.049
George Williams: No, but it's… it's something that, yeah, something that you can't… you… we've now both, you know, you have to address, you have to address it, yeah.

1049
01:43:17.570 --> 01:43:22.740
clive.martin: So, and the other thing that, just to clarify,

1050
01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:29.740
clive.martin: nobody really thinks that the, this Labour government is going to put taxes down.

1051
01:43:30.310 --> 01:43:32.820
clive.martin: They'd like to put more taxes up.

1052
01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:34.739
clive.martin: And down a massive time.

1053
01:43:34.850 --> 01:43:40.790
clive.martin: … So, if… if people are interested in the… in the trust thing.

1054
01:43:41.590 --> 01:43:45.330
clive.martin: Then it really needs to be done before the budget.

1055
01:43:47.170 --> 01:43:48.370
clive.martin: Because if they think….

1056
01:43:48.370 --> 01:43:50.410
George Williams: You think it will change in the budget?

1057
01:43:50.410 --> 01:43:53.360
clive.martin: Well, the issue is, as I always say to people.

1058
01:43:53.590 --> 01:43:58.300
clive.martin: If they don't change it, are you worse off if you put it into placement and you want to do it anyway?

1059
01:43:58.610 --> 01:44:02.870
clive.martin: You're not. If, however, you do it, and they do change it, then you are better off.

1060
01:44:03.260 --> 01:44:09.779
clive.martin: So, the way I think about it is, try and explain it as quickly as possible, and then if someone wants to go ahead.

1061
01:44:10.370 --> 01:44:16.769
clive.martin: just make sure we… we get there first before the budget, and the budget's by end of October, so that sort of thing.

1062
01:44:16.890 --> 01:44:20.060
clive.martin: And it takes a while to sort out the trust, so…

1063
01:44:20.310 --> 01:44:22.990
clive.martin: That's something to bear in mind.

1064
01:44:23.250 --> 01:44:29.260
clive.martin: And that's why, sort of, I'm flagging it up to all clients, in regards to it. But, …

1065
01:44:29.950 --> 01:44:36.749
clive.martin: It's unlikely, you know, they might move it from 7 to 10 years and stuff like that, but we don't think there's going to be wholesale changes, but there might be.

1066
01:44:36.950 --> 01:44:43.100
George Williams: There might be. Okay. It's a risk, you know, you either take or you don't take. Just one other question for you, Clive.

1067
01:44:43.100 --> 01:44:45.710
clive.martin: Sorry, but could I just finish one last thing?

1068
01:44:45.710 --> 01:44:47.140
George Williams: Oh, sorry, carry on, yeah.

1069
01:44:47.140 --> 01:44:50.979
clive.martin: If you give a pet, and you give them money to your children.

1070
01:44:51.980 --> 01:45:02.660
clive.martin: and you lived it 7 years, obviously that's outside. The trust you have with your children is pretty good. So the reality is, if they stuck it in a bank, or they stuck it in an investment.

1071
01:45:02.860 --> 01:45:09.189
clive.martin: over that 7-year period, then… and they can still access it within that period of time, and that's another way of doing it.

1072
01:45:11.650 --> 01:45:13.700
George Williams: Right, yeah, Annie.

1073
01:45:13.860 --> 01:45:14.700
George Williams: Okay.

1074
01:45:15.020 --> 01:45:22.229
clive.martin: So, so… as I call it, a potpourri of loads of different ways of getting to the same issue.

1075
01:45:22.690 --> 01:45:32.209
clive.martin: you've just got to decide what you might feel more comfortable with, and what you think is the best solution for you and your family and Benjo.

1076
01:45:33.390 --> 01:45:35.199
George Williams: Yeah, I'm with you.

1077
01:45:36.860 --> 01:45:51.540
George Williams: Yeah, no, you've given me a lot of thought process to think on there, which… this is what I needed now, because we do need to look at this. I think I'm at an age now where, as you said, you live for 20 more years, which I hope I do, but…

1078
01:45:51.590 --> 01:46:00.910
George Williams: there's options there to reduce that bill dramatically. One other question, I was talking to, well, one of your… Chris Merit, who… whatever.

1079
01:46:01.150 --> 01:46:08.310
George Williams: What he said he's done, Is he is… he's actually set up pensions.

1080
01:46:08.470 --> 01:46:11.620
George Williams: For each one of his grandchu- his…

1081
01:46:12.490 --> 01:46:15.079
George Williams: I think nieces, or nephews, or whoever it is.

1082
01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:15.990
clive.martin: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1083
01:46:15.990 --> 01:46:20.739
George Williams: Is that a tax… Way of doing it, or not?

1084
01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:27.719
clive.martin: Yeah, well, look… If you're… if you're… you could pay a pension contribution for your grandchildren.

1085
01:46:27.940 --> 01:46:28.540
George Williams: Yeah.

1086
01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:36.199
clive.martin: They can do $3,600, you get 20% relief on the contribution, so any cost $2,880.

1087
01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:48.559
clive.martin: Yeah. That's considered a pet, so you live 7 years, it goes outside the estate, but they then have a pension at an early age, and basically they can't… don't forget, they can't get at it until

1088
01:46:48.930 --> 01:46:54.610
clive.martin: Yes. 58, as it were, so if you think you want to have a real long-term planning scenario.

1089
01:46:54.790 --> 01:46:55.420
George Williams: Yeah.

1090
01:46:55.420 --> 01:46:57.030
clive.martin: You can do that.

1091
01:46:57.160 --> 01:47:00.989
clive.martin: And you can also do a junior ISA, which is 9 grand.

1092
01:47:02.840 --> 01:47:11.920
clive.martin: So, if you wanted to have a little, you know, as some grandparents do, and they go, right, how many grandchildren I got? I'm going to give 10 grand to each grandchild. They go, right, I'll…

1093
01:47:12.230 --> 01:47:26.149
clive.martin: Some of it goes into the ISA, because then that's flexible, they can… they can touch it when they're past 18, and that puts some money into a pension. That sorts that whole thing out, and then that's outside the estate, and you know, you know, basically, that's a good thing for them.

1094
01:47:26.890 --> 01:47:29.069
clive.martin: And they can't touch it for a period of time.

1095
01:47:29.860 --> 01:47:30.590
George Williams: Yeah.

1096
01:47:31.090 --> 01:47:45.719
George Williams: Yeah, no, that's what… and Chris was saying that he had… he had given some money to them, his sister's children, who he's godparents to, and he said, you know, when they got to 18, he said they just spent it all overnight.

1097
01:47:45.720 --> 01:47:58.430
George Williams: Literally, within whatever. So, the only way he was going to give them more money is actually by, you know, giving them a pension, so at least when they got the pension age, they'd have something to live on.

1098
01:47:58.570 --> 01:48:01.870
clive.martin: I think… I think one of the issues And…

1099
01:48:02.660 --> 01:48:05.500
clive.martin: I don't want to sound as if I'm on my moral soapbox.

1100
01:48:06.500 --> 01:48:13.700
clive.martin: But… People like yourself think very carefully about what you're trying to do.

1101
01:48:13.810 --> 01:48:18.330
clive.martin: What the… the… actually, the effect it's gonna have on… on… on people.

1102
01:48:18.330 --> 01:48:18.960
George Williams: Yeah.

1103
01:48:20.850 --> 01:48:27.080
clive.martin: Clan said to me last week, which made me laugh, because I hadn't heard the expression, I don't want my grandchildren to be trustafarians.

1104
01:48:27.310 --> 01:48:29.589
clive.martin: And I'm like, I've never heard that.

1105
01:48:30.170 --> 01:48:38.030
clive.martin: 80s thing, that is. You know, so they're so wealthy that basically, but…

1106
01:48:38.130 --> 01:48:44.400
clive.martin: I think the secret is, if money is given to them, given to them in this sort of style.

1107
01:48:44.840 --> 01:48:48.289
clive.martin: That it's the job of not only the giver.

1108
01:48:48.700 --> 01:48:56.630
clive.martin: But also, the dad, because the dads like to be there longer, to educate them that this is… this is… this is a present from…

1109
01:48:57.330 --> 01:49:01.450
clive.martin: Grandparents to make their lives in the long run better.

1110
01:49:01.710 --> 01:49:05.240
clive.martin: I mean, I always remember my grandmother, gave…

1111
01:49:05.430 --> 01:49:10.229
clive.martin: 1,000 pounds, 500 quid, and they… they bought a house on the back garden.

1112
01:49:10.510 --> 01:49:19.959
clive.martin: which they played in to live about 8 or 9 years. They looked after that place like a… like nothing else. They cleaned it every single time, and it's because

1113
01:49:20.230 --> 01:49:27.370
clive.martin: Granny… granny gave to us. Their own rooms were bloody picked, even their parents kept on telling, so it's a completely different story. But emotionally.

1114
01:49:27.370 --> 01:49:28.060
George Williams: Yeah.

1115
01:49:28.060 --> 01:49:29.710
clive.martin: They had a better connection.

1116
01:49:30.610 --> 01:49:43.439
clive.martin: And if you basically… this is, this is, you know, this money is to be spent, you know, your grandparents wanted to give you your first… help with your first car, or some education, or deposit to help with your first house.

1117
01:49:43.970 --> 01:49:50.959
clive.martin: Then it becomes a whole different scenario, and the earlier that you bring them into that educational process, the better it is.

1118
01:49:51.400 --> 01:49:51.810
George Williams: Mmm.

1119
01:49:51.810 --> 01:49:55.220
clive.martin: But most people don't do that, and…

1120
01:49:55.640 --> 01:50:10.000
clive.martin: They get to a point, and they just go, oh, fantastic, so I've got free money, no one's ever talked to me about it. Well, on that basis, I'm just gonna… you know… What were we like at 18? Well, we'll spend it. Oh, can I go to Canada Rugby Tour? I'm going, see ya, bye!

1121
01:50:10.520 --> 01:50:34.090
George Williams: Yeah, you're right. And that's what I thought about that as well, and I thought, long-term pension, that's a long way to go, and whatever. I mean, if you could do something which is, you know, and as you said, educate, you have to educate both, both the grandchild and the parent, in terms of, this is what it's for, it's not to be spent on tattoos, and as Chris said, going out.

1122
01:50:34.090 --> 01:50:42.439
George Williams: binging every, you know, Saturday night, which, apparently, that's what happened with a lot of the money that he gave them.

1123
01:50:42.550 --> 01:50:47.010
George Williams: And he just went, you know, that's not what I gave the money for, and it's.

1124
01:50:47.010 --> 01:50:49.949
clive.martin: No, and I think, I think, I think it's, it's…

1125
01:50:51.670 --> 01:50:57.459
clive.martin: It makes it worse, because then the people… then you feel you've done the wrong thing, even though you have the right intentions.

1126
01:50:57.930 --> 01:51:15.439
George Williams: Yes, yeah, it's an intention I want to make sure works, and not whatever. I think our grandchildren, from what I know of them at the moment, I don't know what they'll be like when they're 18, so you can never tell, but I would hope they've got… they're sensible enough, and I know my… I know my daughter and my…

1127
01:51:15.450 --> 01:51:26.740
George Williams: son so well that they would put a hold on it. But you can only, you know, you can only hold up… if it's in their name and they've got it, that's it, you know. So hopefully they will.

1128
01:51:27.010 --> 01:51:31.830
clive.martin: But that's… and I… and I understand that, and that's why…

1129
01:51:32.160 --> 01:51:36.719
clive.martin: Again, why a lot of people, they do a bit of…

1130
01:51:36.840 --> 01:51:46.429
clive.martin: bit of both, because they don't know, but the discretionary trust has that power to… you're still in that power bit. Yeah. And if they don't know… That's the money.

1131
01:51:46.430 --> 01:51:50.799
George Williams: Please, Granddad!

1132
01:51:50.800 --> 01:51:55.119
clive.martin: Well, I think you have a much better feel for the development of the child.

1133
01:51:55.350 --> 01:51:58.039
clive.martin: What's important to them, and why they want to do it.

1134
01:51:58.130 --> 01:51:59.049
George Williams: Yeah, I agree.

1135
01:51:59.050 --> 01:52:04.360
clive.martin: And then you can, you can tie that in, you know, from that point of view.

1136
01:52:04.510 --> 01:52:06.489
clive.martin: I mean, it's interesting, one of the, …

1137
01:52:06.770 --> 01:52:10.470
clive.martin: One of the, parents who'd done it quite a long time ago.

1138
01:52:10.660 --> 01:52:21.290
clive.martin: said to me, God, you know, my son said to me, that I'd love to go and do an MBA, it's gonna cost a lot of money. Would… would the trust help me out a bit?

1139
01:52:21.390 --> 01:52:23.080
clive.martin: And he said, you really want to do that?

1140
01:52:23.220 --> 01:52:28.840
clive.martin: And he was like, he was so happy that the trust was going to help him with his… …

1141
01:52:29.310 --> 01:52:32.970
clive.martin: And his son was saying, well, I don't think I can go, because I can't afford it.

1142
01:52:33.420 --> 01:52:35.809
clive.martin: And that was exactly what it was there for, but….

1143
01:52:35.810 --> 01:52:36.330
George Williams: Yeah, 100%.

1144
01:52:36.330 --> 01:52:44.769
clive.martin: He had no idea that was going to be the situation. So, that's the thing about life, you don't know what you don't know.

1145
01:52:44.940 --> 01:52:51.040
clive.martin: You don't know. But when you can combine that in the right areas, you can make a real big difference.

1146
01:52:51.670 --> 01:52:52.080
George Williams: Yeah.

1147
01:52:52.080 --> 01:52:54.839
clive.martin: And that's… that's why I think, …

1148
01:52:56.070 --> 01:52:58.829
clive.martin: It's a nice… it's a nice halfway house to do it.

1149
01:52:58.830 --> 01:53:09.880
George Williams: It is. I like that discussion, Ritas, and the life cover. I'm not so keen on that, but I can see the benefit of that, and absolutely, as you say, you get the money back.

1150
01:53:10.090 --> 01:53:14.989
George Williams: easily over 50%, plus. Okay.

1151
01:53:15.690 --> 01:53:17.220
clive.martin: Is that, is that… I mean….

1152
01:53:17.220 --> 01:53:18.310
George Williams: I think that is a lot of.

1153
01:53:18.310 --> 01:53:21.600
clive.martin: If we've burdened you with a whole lot of stuff today.

1154
01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:24.010
George Williams: No, no, I mean, I won't….

1155
01:53:24.010 --> 01:53:26.789
clive.martin: I wanted to go through it, because I think….

1156
01:53:27.090 --> 01:53:27.810
George Williams: Yes.

1157
01:53:28.180 --> 01:53:32.220
clive.martin: Time to chew it over, and have a thought.

1158
01:53:32.430 --> 01:53:33.140
clive.martin: ….

1159
01:53:33.140 --> 01:53:52.760
George Williams: It is something that we're really thinking about now, Clive, and I think those type of things, we need to start putting into place. I think financially, I'm okay, because we're not massive, great big spenders. I'm not going to go out and buy a Porsche tomorrow, as you know, you've known me too long now, you know. Yeah, we want to take some more holidays.

1160
01:53:52.760 --> 01:54:05.579
George Williams: And yeah, I might be spending another extra 10, or maybe even 20 grand a year on some holidays, but that certainly is not going to break the bank or really affect what we're doing here, I don't think, in any way.

1161
01:54:05.580 --> 01:54:17.230
clive.martin: But even… even… even if… even if you thought, I'm not going to do 85, I'm gonna do 100 grand, another 15 grand… Yeah. That's only 2 million, that's still 700,000 short. So, I mean, it's like, there's… there's…

1162
01:54:18.010 --> 01:54:21.209
clive.martin: I think we've got to a point now that you can do whatever you want.

1163
01:54:21.630 --> 01:54:23.010
George Williams: Yeah, no.

1164
01:54:23.230 --> 01:54:28.039
clive.martin: Which is nice, nice, but we weren't expecting to have

1165
01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:33.760
clive.martin: to worry about an IHT scenario as much as we are today. But hang-ho, that's…

1166
01:54:33.960 --> 01:54:35.759
clive.martin: That's the way the….

1167
01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:43.989
George Williams: Yeah, you know, you always thought the whole SIP thing was brilliant, because you go, yeah, pass this on down, it's all tax-free, thank you very much.

1168
01:54:44.630 --> 01:54:51.269
George Williams: But, yeah. Anyway, it is what it is. So, you can't cry over spilt milk, as they say, but, ….

1169
01:54:51.270 --> 01:54:52.210
clive.martin: Officer, is that?

1170
01:54:52.350 --> 01:54:53.900
clive.martin: I should have mentioned.

1171
01:54:54.370 --> 01:54:56.509
clive.martin: Are you active on 2 minutes, just not 2 minutes?

1172
01:54:56.510 --> 01:55:00.909
George Williams: Yeah, no, I've got to go shortly, because I've got a meeting at 6.15, yeah.

1173
01:55:00.910 --> 01:55:08.880
clive.martin: 2027 is when the… allegedly, the SIP will come into the… into your estate.

1174
01:55:09.300 --> 01:55:10.110
George Williams: Right.

1175
01:55:10.920 --> 01:55:18.569
clive.martin: Now, they just had 6 months of consultation, and you can't tax a trust on death.

1176
01:55:19.910 --> 01:55:26.010
clive.martin: So, if they want to change… if they change this rule, they're gonna have to change the rules, they're gonna have to do an Act of Parliament.

1177
01:55:26.210 --> 01:55:29.750
clive.martin: So there's discussion now about pushing it out to 2028.

1178
01:55:31.020 --> 01:55:41.539
clive.martin: If you do… if you push it out to 2028, the next election is 2029. If you did that and dragged everyone into an IHT bill, liability, in 2028,

1179
01:55:41.730 --> 01:55:44.910
clive.martin: What are the chances of being elected in 2029?

1180
01:55:45.610 --> 01:55:46.850
George Williams: Yeah, none.

1181
01:55:46.850 --> 01:55:48.930
clive.martin: So… so…

1182
01:55:49.680 --> 01:55:57.660
clive.martin: Look, you don't… we think that it's not the most sensible thing, they haven't really understood it well enough to see the impact.

1183
01:55:57.810 --> 01:56:02.769
clive.martin: … And I think they'll be pushing that out, and it won't… won't…

1184
01:56:03.330 --> 01:56:08.679
clive.martin: No. But it's always possible it could come in, and therefore, if it does come in, that just makes it worse.

1185
01:56:09.010 --> 01:56:11.679
clive.martin: So, you know, but I just thought.

1186
01:56:11.680 --> 01:56:12.140
George Williams: white.

1187
01:56:12.140 --> 01:56:18.430
clive.martin: I'll give you the update in terms of that. So, are you going to a committee meeting or something, or are you just going to have a few beers down the road?

1188
01:56:18.430 --> 01:56:28.450
George Williams: No, no, I've got an update on some commercial… I'm, you know, I'm the commercial manager, so I've got a new sponsorship scheme going on. We lost a couple of our sponsors, unfortunately.

1189
01:56:28.640 --> 01:56:36.860
George Williams: This year, again, just financial issues while they can't do it. We've been promoting now 4 years on the trot. We've got a.

1190
01:56:36.860 --> 01:56:37.880
clive.martin: Interesting.

1191
01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:53.039
George Williams: Yeah, we've got an amazing setup. We're playing in London leagues now, and it… yeah, we've got… everything's clicked at the right time, right? Captain, right players we've attracted. In the local area, you know, we've beaten all the local sides now, so…

1192
01:56:53.040 --> 01:57:01.059
George Williams: you know, we're playing some top-quality sides now, and … sponsorship is just something… I mean, I raise about 20 grand a year.

1193
01:57:01.340 --> 01:57:06.360
George Williams: But we had 2 pull out, which meant it dropped down to 14, and I'm trying to get

1194
01:57:06.540 --> 01:57:13.369
George Williams: More sponsors back in, and you know what, it's so hard to get people to sponsor these type of clubs at the moment, so…

1195
01:57:13.760 --> 01:57:22.309
George Williams: I've been making up a whole load of marketing blurb to send out to people to say, yeah, this is what our bronze package, gold package.

1196
01:57:22.310 --> 01:57:24.469
George Williams: a platinum package, and this…

1197
01:57:24.470 --> 01:57:45.189
George Williams: what, selling players for the year, you know, you buy a player for the year, 200 quid, and you get your name there, da-da-da-da. So, we're trying to sell to everybody, and the best thing is, in-house, we've got lots of mum and dads from minis and juniors that work for companies, work for businesses, and it's starting to pay off, so it's quite good fun, actually.

1198
01:57:45.190 --> 01:57:51.060
clive.martin: Well, so who is your… who are you pla… who are the top people in the division you've got now, then?

1199
01:57:51.240 --> 01:57:53.959
clive.martin: Well, people like Cobham and those….

1200
01:57:53.960 --> 01:57:56.240
George Williams: Yeah, so, yeah, we're playing up.

1201
01:57:56.240 --> 01:57:58.260
clive.martin: They really are, you really are, you are really playing.

1202
01:57:58.260 --> 01:58:01.940
George Williams: Playing it in the big boys league now!

1203
01:58:01.940 --> 01:58:06.499
clive.martin: And then, so is this going into this season, you're going into that league, or…? Yeah.

1204
01:58:06.500 --> 01:58:18.509
George Williams: Yeah, yeah, so it will be, it will be, yeah, we're traveling quite a… a way away, so, you know, but yeah, we'll… we'll see. Sometimes you go, hmm…

1205
01:58:18.840 --> 01:58:33.829
George Williams: have we reached the level we want to get to? And that's what worries me. We've done this before, not quite as high as this, but we've done it before, when Gareth was playing, actually, and … we hit that level, and we came down like a…

1206
01:58:34.010 --> 01:58:35.610
George Williams: stone.

1207
01:58:35.770 --> 01:58:40.890
George Williams: I mean, we just fell and kept falling. Because once you start getting beaten.

1208
01:58:41.280 --> 01:58:47.710
George Williams: People go, do you know what? I've had enough of this this season, I'm gonna go off and play for so-and-so. They're an up-and-coming club.

1209
01:58:47.750 --> 01:58:53.770
clive.martin: Yeah. And all of a sudden, the whole ethos of the club's just… Yeah, yeah. I think changes.

1210
01:58:53.770 --> 01:58:58.910
George Williams: And you have to rebuild from grassroots again, so, … Yeah.

1211
01:58:59.180 --> 01:59:01.229
clive.martin: Well, best of luck with it.

1212
01:59:01.660 --> 01:59:02.300
George Williams: Totally.

1213
01:59:02.590 --> 01:59:07.080
clive.martin: Okay, well, look, lovely to speak to you, and we'll speak soon, and ….

1214
01:59:07.250 --> 01:59:08.100
George Williams: Yes.

1215
01:59:08.100 --> 01:59:08.960
clive.martin: Take it from there.

1216
01:59:09.250 --> 01:59:12.109
George Williams: We'll do. Thanks for your time, Clive, appreciate it.

1217
01:59:12.110 --> 01:59:14.180
clive.martin: No problems at all. Okay, bye. And you take care.
